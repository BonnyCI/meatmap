\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 FOCUS:
\b0 \
How does a city\'92s GDP impact meet-ups success? \
\

\b Following questions:
\b0 \
What does a city\'92s GDP say about it\'92s job trends?\
How do you define a meetup\'92s success?\
Does a change in GDP also correlate to a change in number/success of meet-ups?\
\

\b How does this help answer the larger question?
\b0 \
I think meet-ups are a kind of public good \'97 where there is no real economic benefit for hosting meet ups but there is a social and professional benefit. So understanding how a city\'92s economic position influences how willing people are to attend meet-ups will allow us to target new cities and also predict if a city\'92s meet up culture might rise or fall.}
