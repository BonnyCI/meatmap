A place for new contributors to explore and learn about data science using the Meatmap project.

To participate:

1. Fork the repo into your own Github account
2. Create a new folder here with your github username. Your work will go here, you can organize it however you like.
3. At a minimum create an R notebook (.Rmd) and add it to your new folder. Add something to it, commit, and submit a pull request. Github makes this super easy!
