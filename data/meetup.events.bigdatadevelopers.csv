Â  At its heart, Tensorflow is a numerical computing library such asÂ numpyÂ andÂ scipy. Tensorflow follows a graph processingÂ approachÂ unlikeÂ numpyÂ andÂ scipyÂ that performÂ immediateÂ computation. In this tutorial, we will first learn the fundamentals of Tensorflow, its philosophy, basic functions and finally solve a simple computational problem. Then we will learn to program a deep learning Convolution Neural Network (CNN).Â </p> <p><br/><b>Bio:</b>Â  Dr. Ravi Chityala is a Senior Engineer at Elekta Inc. He has more than 12 years of experience in image processing and scientific computing. He is also a part-time instructor at University of California Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley Extension, Santa Clara, CA, where he teaches advanced Python to programmers.

This talk covers how to leverage HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) - a new type of neural network - to create applications that learn in real time, automatically and without the need for data labelling.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio: </b>Marion Le Borgne is a Machine Learning Researcher and the Co-Founder of NeuroTechX, the international neurotechnology network. She started her career as a Venture Capital Analyst at Partech International Ventures which led her to dive deeper in the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. She's a big advocate for HTM, a novel type of neural network, that she contributed to when she was a Senior Software Engineer at Numenta.Â </p> <p><b>""Explaining decisions from black-box models"", Alyssa Frazee, Machine Learning Engineer, Stripe</b></p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> Machine learning models are often described as “magic” or “black boxes”: the important thing is what goes into them and what comes out, not necessarily how that output is calculated. Sometimes this is what we want: many consumers don’t really need to see inside the sausage factory, as they say—they just want a tasty tubular treat. But other times, a prediction from a box full of magic isn’t satisfying. In Stripe’s production machine learning system that declines high-risk credit card charges, businesses and customers often (rightly) want to know why our decline system made the decision it did. This talk will illustrate how we give reasons for our system’s risk judgments on payments.</p> <p><b>Bio:Â </b>Alyssa is a machine learning engineer at Stripe, where she builds models to prevent online credit card fraud. Before Stripe, she did a PhD in biostatistics and fell in love with programming at the Recurse Center.</p> <p><b>""Experiments at Affirm"", Siyang Li, Data Scientist - Analytics, Affirm</b></p> <p><b>Abstract:Â </b>Experiments at Affirm: we'll go over some of the challenges that we've overcome in rolling out experiments here.

She's been spending her time focusing on design of experiments here, specifically in the digital communications area. Prior to Affirm, she was a data scientist at Capital One for over two years, where she did signal monitoring for the underwriting model, building a predictive model in collections, as well as internal tools development.Â </p> <p><b>""New Trends in Machine Learning"", Lilian Weng, Data Scientist, Affirm</b></p> <p><b>Abstract:Â </b>During this talk, we will review severalÂ latestÂ trends and hot topics in the machine learning field, especially in AI research and deep learning. While going through those research findings, we will check out examples of real world applications, how deep learning affects traditional machine learning models, and its inspiration for our future research &amp; development at Affirm.</p> <p><b>Bio:Â </b>Lilian Weng joined Affirm as the first female data scientist and has been actively working on the improvement of its underwriting model. Her PhD research focused on modeling information diffusion on online social networks using data in the wild and methods from both epidemiology and applied machine learning. Before joining Affirm, she has worked on gating system, full-text search, and the first event-based home feed at Dropbox.

<b>About Minted</b></p> <p>A design marketplace, sourcing creative content from a global community of independent artists, then sell the best content in the form of art, home dÃ©cor, and stationery, directly to consumers. By pioneering crowdsourcing, Minted has held art and design challenges monthly since April 2008, open for both submission and voting, the 'crowd' curates Minted's product selection by rating products, utilizes analytics to evaluate votes. We are mobilizing and activating creative people, and enabling them to monetize their art by identifying the industries and products where their art is most interesting to consumers. Minted produces and sells winning designs, paying the designer a commission on every sale. In addition, winning artists and designers have stores on Minted. They can launch any of their creations into their stores, utilizing Minted's manufacturing, fulfillment, and customer service capabilities to run their businesses.</p> <p>Tech Stack:JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Flux,Python, PHP, SQL, Puppet, Ansible, Fabric, Docker, AWS - EC2, ELB, ASG</p> <p>The storyline...Mariam Naficy founded Minted in 2007. The daughter of a development economist, she grew up in 5 countries in the Middle East and Africa. Having seen interesting art and design in her travels, as well as the art created by her own family members, she was intrigued in 2007 by the idea that there was hidden creative talent around the world whose work was not accessible to consumers and that the Internet could help surface. Her founding question: could crowd-sourcing design build an e-commerce company that stayed in tune with its consumer audience forever?Â </p> <p>The company held its first ""design challenge"" in 2008, a save-the-date card design competition that attracted 66 entries. Initially, the company balanced its crowd-sourcing approach by also carrying stationery brands, almost failed, and was panned by the media. Naficy raised $11 million in cash to last through seven years of operation, brought the company to cash-flow break-even with a lean team by 2012, then raised a first large funding round in 2013.Â </p> <p>Tens of thousands of design and art entries later, the company has expanded into the art business and the home dÃ©cor business and its products have reached 40 million homes. The company is backed by Benchmark Capital, IDG Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Technology Crossover Ventures, and Norwest Venture Partners, and has raised $90 million in capital. LinkedIn named Minted as one of 2014's 10 Most In-Demand Start-Ups among job seekers. Naficy was named one of the 25 Most Creative People in Business by Fast Company in 2013.</p> <p>ABOUT US // <a href=""https://www.minted.com/about-us""><a href=""https://www.minted.com/about-us"" class=""linkified"">https://www.minted.com/about-us</a></a><br/>TESTIMONIALS // <a href=""https://www.minted.com/testimonials""><a href=""https://www.minted.com/testimonials"" class=""linkified"">https://www.minted.com/testimonials</a></a><br/>JOBS PAGE // <a href=""https://www.minted.com/jobs""><a href=""https://www.minted.com/jobs"" class=""linkified"">https://www.minted.com/jobs</a></a></p> ",public,120,25274133,Minted,37.79842758178711,-122.40018463134766,false,747 Front Street,San Francisco,US,USA,,,,,,,,

<b>Talk1 : Beyond 50,000 Partitions: How Heroku Operates and Pushes the Limits of Kafka at Scale</b></p> <p>At Heroku, we offer Apache Kafka as a service to a large number of distinct users, each with a varying number of use cases. Our goal is to provide this service to users while removing many of the operational headaches that comes with running infrastructure like this at scale.<br/>While we run a robust service today, it took a lot of effort to get here. Early on, we uncovered a variety of failures scenarios. One such problem surfaced when a large number of concurrent admin commands, such as topic or consumer group creation, would cause a cascading broker failure. Our users would then observe not only enormous latencies around these admin commands, but also see a considerable drop in throughput until our infrastructure automatically recovered. It was important for us to address this because it would only get worse as our user base grew.<br/>Once we overcame this hurdle, we discovered another problem later on where brokers would fail when a large number of users would constantly go above their quota. This was, in part, a result of our decision to leverage quotas to ensure our users could coexist and behave among each other. However, it turned out to be another case of cascading broker failures since the underlying quota implementation, based on traffic shaping, had a memory leak that caused out-of-memory errors one broker at a time.<br/>In this talk, we will continue with our stories above in greater detail and share more anecdotes of how we discovered and addressed interesting behaviors and gotchas as we scaled our infrastructure to ensure a robust and trustworthy service for our growing user base.</p> <p><b>Speaker:Â </b></p> <p><b>Jeff Chao</b> is a software engineer at Heroku where he is a member of the Department of Data. Prior to Heroku, he worked on streaming data processing systems where he built event processing engines, data ingestion pipelines, and pub sub services. He has additional experience in fields such as ad tech, messaging, and marketing automation derived from past startups. Jeff's current work involves delivering and maintaining Apache Kafka as a service.</p> <p>



<b> Talk2: What the brain tells us about the future of streaming analyticsÂ </b></p> <p>Much of the world’s data is becoming streaming, time-series data. It becomes increasingly important to analyze streaming data in real-time. Hierarchal Temporal Memory (HTM) is a detailed computational theory of the neocortex. At the core of HTM are time-based learning algorithms that store and recall spatial and temporal patterns. HTM is well suited to a wide variety of problems; particularly those involve streaming data and time-based patterns. The current HTM systems are able to learn the structure of streaming data, make predictions and detect anomalies. It is distinguished from other techniques in its ability to learn continuously in a fully unsupervised manner. HTM has been tested and implemented in software, all of which is developed with best practices and is suitable for deploying in commercial applications. The core learning algorithms are fully documented and available in an open source project called NuPIC. HTM not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.Â </p> <p><b>Speaker</b></p> <p><b>Yuwei Cui</b> a Research Staff Member at Numenta, a company focused on Machine Intelligence.

It includes everything needed to build a full-blown predictive system: Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Incubating Airflow, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Apache Parquet, Python/Flask, JQuery.Â </p> <p>This talk will cover the full lifecycle of large data application development and will show how to use lessons from agile software engineering to apply data science using this full-stack to build better analytics applications.Â </p> <p>The entire lifecycle of big data application development is discussed. The system starts with plumbing, moving on to data tables, charts and search, through interactive reports, and building towards predictions in both batch and realtime (and defining the role for both), the deployment of predictive systems and how to iteratively improve predictions that prove valuable by building an experimental setup.Â </p> <p><b>About the SpeakerÂ <br/></b><br/>Russell JurneyÂ is principal consultant at Data Syndrome, a product analytics consultancy dedicated to advancing the adoption of the development methodology Agile Data Science, as outlined in the book Agile Data Science 2.0 (O'Reilly, 2017).Â </p> <p>He has worked as a data scientist building data products for over a decade, starting in interactive web visualization and then moving towards full-stack data products, machine learning and artificial intelligence at companies such as Ning, LinkedIn, Hortonworks and Relato.Â </p> <p>He is a self-taught visualization software engineer, data engineer, data scientist, writer and most recently, he's becoming a teacher.

We’ll use Spark to power product recommendations and natural language processing tasks. In just 2 days, you will take your data skills to the next level by using Spark to build data pipelines.</p> <p>Workshop instructors will be on-hand all weekend to teach, live code, and help debug as you work through the course materials.</p> <p><b>Who is this course for?</b> This is an introductory course on Spark for anyone who has a personal or professional interest in data science.</p> <p>We assume you don't know anything in particular about Spark. All you need to come to our workshop is a working knowledge of programming to get through the course materials, a Macintosh or Linux laptop, and a readiness to learn.</p> <p>If you don’t have a Mac or Linux computer, we can provide a Galvanize workstation for your use during the workshop.</p> <p>The more you know before the course, the more you’ll get out of it, so we do recommend the pre-course materials below:</p> <p>We strongly recommendÂ  <a href=""https://www.continuum.io/downloads/"">installing Anaconda</a>, the distribution of Python that is most useful for data science and data engineering.Â  <a href=""https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/"">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>Â is a free, long-form Python tutorial that will help to reinforce your basic Python skills, especially if you are relatively new to Python coding.After you register for the course, your Galvanize instructors will provide detailed instructions for installing and configuring Spark on your computer, and will help you along the way if you need it. <b>Course Outline</b>:</p> <p>July 15 - July 16,Â 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM PDT. Light breakfast and lunch are included.</p> <p>In this two-day, in-person, hands-on Spark course, we will:</p> <p>•Â Import, clean, and query data using Spark RDDs and Spark SQL. •Â Build a product recommendation system using Spark.</p> <p>•Â Perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Spark.</p> <p>•Â Use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deploy a Spark cluster.</p> <p>•Â Use a Spark cluster to process large datasets that cannot fit on your personal computer.</p> <p><b>Why Spark?</b></p> <p>Spark is a powerful, open-source processing engine for data distributed across large clusters. Spark is optimized for speed and ease of use; it uses caching and memory to run distributed algorithms 100x faster than MapReduce. Spark can be used for batch processing and for processing data in near real-time.</p> <p>Also, used by data professionals at Amazon, eBay, NASA, and 200+ other organizations, Spark’s community is one of the fastest growing in the world.</p> <p><b>Software &amp; Prerequisite Requirements:</b> This workshop series is for anyone who wants to use Spark to analyze data at scale.</p> <p><b>Programming Experience</b>:</p> <p>Course examples and exercises will use Python and PySpark. Basic working knowledge of the Python programming language (i.e. the ability to write scripts and functions in Python) is required.</p> <p><b>Command Line &amp; Version Control</b>:</p> <p>Basic knowledge of Unix commands (i.e. command line) is required.</p> <p>We will use GitHub for sharing and maintaining code. If you do not already have a GitHub account, you will need to create one before class begins.</p> <p><b>Technology Requirements</b>:</p> <p>Students are expected to bring a personal computer running the Mac OS X or Linux operating system, with at least 4GB of RAM and at least 6GB of free disk space.</p> <p><b>Refund policy</b> Cancel more than 48 hours before the first class: Full Refund (minus processing fee).Cancel after the first day: Can apply the cost to a different program, no refund.</p> <p>*Students are responsible for monitoring and controlling expenses incurred on their own Amazon Web Services accounts. A typical student is expected to spend less than $50 on AWS usage during this course. Amazon bills by the hour for usage of cloud resources and students are advised to shut down their Spark clusters at the end of the workshop. Accidentally leaving a Spark cluster running when it is not in use could result in significant overages.</p> <p><b>About Galvanize</b>: <a href=""http://galvanize.com/"">Galvanize</a>Â is the premiere dynamic learning community for technology.

This session will highlight this implementation of Stream API for big-data processing across many machines from the comfort of your Java Application.<br/>With an explanation of internals of the implementation, I will give an introduction to the general design behind stream processing using DAG (directed acyclic graph) engines and how an actor-based implementation can provide in-memory performance while still leveraging industry-wide known frameworks as Java Streams API.</p> <p><b>Speaker BIO:</b></p> <p>Fuad Malikov is a co-founder of Hazelcast, a Java-based, open-source operational in-memory computing platform.

However, many people assume that:</p> <p>1. Only specialist areas like deep learning are suitable for GPU</p> <p>2. Learning to program a GPU takes years of developing specialist knowledge</p> <p>It turns out that neither assumption is true! Nearly any non-recursive algorithm that operates on datasets of 1000+ items can be accelerated by a GPU.
