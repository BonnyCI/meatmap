"4","1473887662000","<p>Join us for some food, drinks, mingle and interesting Weather talk with Margriet on October 12. </p> <p>Weather is a source of fascination and endless conversation. When you combine weather data sets with twitter chatter about the weather, what kinds of surprising insights might you find? Are the weather sentiments on Twitter related to the actual weather and forecasts? </p> <p>This talk shows you how to <b>extract, combine, and analyze Twitter and weather feeds in Python, using Spark, Insight for Twitter, Weather Company Data for Bluemix and Watson Tone Analyser. </b>We will explore how to analyse this data in a Python notebook to draw insights into patterns and sentiment that may not otherwise be apparent. The talk covers how to:</p> <p>- Extract Twitter feeds daily and store them into Cloudant database. <br/>- Analyze the tweet sentiment using Watson Tone Analyzer.<br/>- Deploy Weather Company Data for Bluemix to collect daily weather data and load it into Hadoop.<br/>- Combine and analyze the stored data to understand correlations between sentiment and weather in a Python notebook using Spark and multivariate statistical methods. We’ll also use clustering algorithms to compare correlations between regions to find out if the English weather really is as bad as they say.</p> <p>This is a fun sample problem showing how you can combine and analyse large and small data sets to uncover trends and patterns. The techniques presented in this talk are applicable to a wide variety of questions. You can easily add or swap out data sources to extend or adapt the examples given. This session is recommended for anyone looking to widen their skill set in working with data, particularly in a cloud environment.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Margriet Groenendijk is a Developer Advocate at IBM Cloud Data Services. She is all about data: from storing, cleaning, and munging through to analysing and visualising. She has a passion for creating clear plots and models that tease new insights from diverse data sets using tools like Cloudant NoSQL databases, data warehouses, Spark, and Python notebooks. Her PhD work explored large datasets of carbon uptake by forests. As a Research Fellow, she analysed very large observational datasets and the output of global scale climate models. She has written several scientific articles and regularly presents her work at international conferences.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.</p> <p>That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value. On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:<br/>-  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>-  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>-   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>-   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>-   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>-   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark and access the live-stream, you can sign up now for a reminder.  Please go to:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><br/><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p><br/>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.</p> <p>That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value. On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including: </p> <p>-   Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>-   Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>-   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>-   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>-   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>-   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark and access the live-stream, you can sign up now for a reminder.  Please go to:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><br/><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>

Making Hadoop Better with NoSQL.</b></p> <p>Hadoop has become popular because it is designed to cheaply store that data in the Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) and run large-scale MapReduce jobs for batch analysis. However Hadoop is not designed for low latency transactions required for real-time interactive applications, or applications that require enterprise features such as government-grade security and high availability and disaster recovery. Even as the Hadoop ecosystem continues to evolve, the real benefits of Hadoop are enhanced when running alongside an enterprise-grade database.</p> <p>



<b>2. The Requirements of an Enterprise NoSQL platform.</b></p> <p><br/>As more and more businesses look towards NoSQL as providing a better platform choice over traditional RDBMS to support business agility, they soon discover a myriad of offerings all pro-porting to deliver on Big Data challenges. However, quite soon small pilots evolve and developers being to encounter coding complexity as they attempt resolve lacking database features which they take for granted from their mature enterprise RDBMS equivalents. <br/>We will discuss the common enterprise feature challenges and what differentiates an Enterprise NoSQL platform to highlight the pitfalls and considerations of new deployments.</p> <p>

Drawing from real-world cases, they will each present a 30-minute thought provoking session on the trends in this fascinating and rapidly evolving area of technology.</p> <p><br/>""Organisations of all types need to observe behavior, activities, and other changing information over time – and generate actionable intelligence that lets them intervene to keep their customers, the public, or their businesses safe from harm.</p> <p><br/>• Law enforcement organizations perform suspicious activity monitoring as a foundational part of police and detective work</p> <p><br/>• Financial services institutions improve oversight with “know your customer” (KYC), anti-money-laundering, and trader surveillance initiatives</p> <p><br/>• National defence and security agencies “connect the dots” in disparate data to prevent terrorist attacks</p> <p><br/>• Healthcare and insurance organizations look for potential claims fraud</p> <p><br/>• Nearly every industry has teams focusing on cyber-crime and cyber-defence</p> <p><br/>In all cases, it is crucial to integrate data from a variety of heterogeneous sources – as fast as possible – and provide alerts on unusual activities to the people who need to know and respond.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p><br/>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.</p> <p>That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value. On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:<br/>-  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>-  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>-  Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>-  Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>-  Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>-  Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark and access the live-stream, you can sign up now for a reminder.  Please go to:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.<br/></b></p> <p><br/>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University<br/><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information<br/><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1413921034000","17774822","open","28.670000076293945","77.20999908447266","Big Data Developers in Delhi","Big-Data-Developers-in-Delhi","Members","","223015867","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Delhi/events/223015867/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data and design (Web Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428591000","19800000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","46","Big-Data-Developers-in-Delhi"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:</p> <p>•  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1399129544000","14245342","open","32.06999969482422","34.77000045776367","Big Data Developers in Tel Aviv-Yafo","Big-Data-Developers-in-Tel-Aviv-Yafo","Big Data Enthusiasts","","223230533","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Tel-Aviv-Yafo/events/223230533/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428598000","10800000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","24","Big-Data-Developers-in-Tel-Aviv-Yafo"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:<br/>  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1364206246000","7770902","open","-34.61000061035156","-58.369998931884766","Big Data Developers in Buenos Aires","Big-Data-Developers-in-Buenos-Aires","Developers","","223231189","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Buenos-Aires/events/223231189/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only))","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428598000","-10800000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","15","Big-Data-Developers-in-Buenos-Aires"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:</p> <p>•  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1364206193000","7770872","open","-23.530000686645508","-46.630001068115234","Big Data Developers in Sao Paulo","Big-Data-Developers-in-Sao-Paulo","Developers","","223230514","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Sao-Paulo/events/223230514/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data and design (Web Conference)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428598000","-10800000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","35","Big-Data-Developers-in-Sao-Paulo"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:<br/>  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1414503432000","17917152","open","31.229999542236328","121.47000122070312","Big Data Developers in Shanghai","Big-Data-Developers-in-Shanghai","Members","","223231160","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Shanghai/events/223231160/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428598000","28800000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","6","Big-Data-Developers-in-Shanghai"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:</p> <p>•  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1415285865000","18113312","open","46.060001373291016","14.510000228881836","Big Data Developers in Slovenia","Big-Data-Developers-in-Slovenia","Members","","223229950","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Slovenia/events/223229950/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only))","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428596000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","2","Big-Data-Developers-in-Slovenia"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:<br/>  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1380486764000","10477712","open","41.400001525878906","2.1700000762939453","Big Data Developers in Barcelona","Big-Data-Developers-in-Barcelona","members","","223231134","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Barcelona/events/223231134/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only))","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428598000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","14","Big-Data-Developers-in-Barcelona"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

Abstract:</p> <p><br/>Currently DeepLearning - large neural networks with advanced topologies - are taking over the machine learning ecosystem. In the case of times series they currently are superseding Hidden Markov models and other traditional algorithms. In this talk we will show how Deep Neural Networks can be used for anomaly detection on high dimensional network monitoring data. Do it yourself and read accelerometer data from your mobile device and stream this data to via MQTT to the Watson IoT Platform. Learn how to classify this data into different movement patterns (standing/sitting, walking, running, dancing).</p> ","7200000","1400265324000","14493632","open","48.220001220703125","16.3700008392334","Big Data Developers in Vienna","Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna","Big Data Enthusiasts","","232609255","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna/events/232609255/","","BerlinTOA LiveStream: DeepLearning and Advanced Machine Learning on IoT","","","","past","1468591200000","1468599624000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","7","Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna"

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that´s why ""In Silico Medicine"" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live"" class=""embedded"">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ","1800000","1400265324000","14493632","open","48.220001220703125","16.3700008392334","Big Data Developers in Vienna","Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna","Big Data Enthusiasts","","234293154","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna/events/234293154/","","Webcast MipTec Basel: Massive parallel GPU accelerated DeepLearning in the cloud","","","","past","1474555500000","1474559248000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","2","Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna"

Title: Apache Cassandra &amp; Apache Spark for Time Series Data (45 minutes)</p> <p>Presenter: Patrick McFadin</p> <p>Bio: Patrick McFadin is regarded as one of the experts of Apache Cassandra and data modeling techniques. As the Chief Evangelist for Apache Cassandra and consultant for DataStax, he has helped build some of the largest deployments in the world. Previous to DataStax, he was Chief Architect at Hobsons, an education services company. There, he spoke often on Web Application design and performance.</p> <p>Synopsis: Apache Cassandra has proven to be one of the best solutions for storing and retrieving time series data at high velocity and high volume. This talk will discuss how the storage model of Cassandra is ideal for time series use cases and go over examples of how to best build data models. We will also cover pairing Apache Spark with Apache Cassandra to create a real time data analytics platform. Attendees will leave this session knowing how to build their own real time data analytics platform, and will be shocked at how easy it is!</p> ","7200000","1400181332000","14476282","open","48.13999938964844","11.579999923706055","Big Data Developers in Munich","Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich","Members","","217571312","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/217571312/","","Apache Cassandra, Apache Spark and Hadoop Meetup","","","","past","1416333600000","1416393150000","3600000","Gotzinger Str. 8","","München","de","20367322","48.12128448486328","Germany","11.550056457519531","Impact HUB","","False","","","public","0","58","Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

Flink is one of the most active big data projects in the Apache Software Foundation and has more than 100 contributors. The core of Flink is a distributed stream processing engine that enables low-latency and high throughput data processing. Flink has high-level APIs for both stream and batch processing.<br/>In the first part of this talk we will briefly look at the history of Flink and then present the APIs and different use cases. Here we will also see how it can be deployed in practice.<br/>In the second part, we will look at the streaming execution engine that powers Flink. Here we will see what makes it tick and also what distinguishes it from other approaches, such as the mini-batch execution model. We will cover Flink's architecture and design decisions that result in Flink's unique set of features.</p> <p><i>Feeding a Squirrel in Time -- Windows in Apache Flink </i></p> <p>In data stream processing, the dimension of time is a crucial aspect with regard to runtime effects as well as query semantics. There are two different time concepts: event-time also called occurrence time, ie, the time in which an event happens in the real world, and processing-time, ie, the time in which an events gets processed by the system. Both time dimensions deliver different semantics if used to specify windows on a data stream.<br/>In this talk, we give an introduction to time-base data stream<br/>processing and cover Flink's approach to handle windowing. Flink offers a broad range of (non-/)deterministic count-, time-, and custom-windows while offering a simple API to express those.</p> <p>Please note that this event has also been posted here: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/""><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/</a></a></p> <p>We would like to thank our host Inovex GmbH for providing the location, food and drinks.</p> ","","1400181332000","14476282","open","48.13999938964844","11.579999923706055","Big Data Developers in Munich","Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich","Members","","226576873","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/226576873/","","Stream & Batch Processing with Apache Flink and Event-Time Windowing","","","","past","1447263000000","1447278875000","3600000","Valentin-Linhof-Straße 2","","München","de","22197842","48.13539123535156","Germany","11.663948059082031","inovex GmbH - Office München","+49 89 726 332 62-0","False","","","public","0","40","Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich"

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that´s why ""In Silico Medicine"" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live"" class=""embedded"">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ","1800000","1400181332000","14476282","open","48.13999938964844","11.579999923706055","Big Data Developers in Munich","Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich","Members","","234293143","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/234293143/","","Webcast MipTec Basel: Massive parallel GPU accelerated DeepLearning in the cloud","","","","past","1474555500000","1474559248000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","14","Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich"

Discussion 1</p> <p>

Title:  Building a Reactive RESTful API with Akka HTTP and Slick</p> <p>

Abstract:</p> <p><br/>Zalando’s engineering team is currently rebuilding our “shop”—the unit that includes our 15 country-specific, customer-facing websites—to transform it from a monolith into a microservices architecture. As part of this work, we have developed open-source tools in a variety of languages. One of this tools, Innkeeper, is a simple, RESTful route management API built on top of reactive technologies like Akka HTTP and Slick. It will help our fleet of router instances to keep their routes in sync.</p> <p><br/>In this presentation, I'll discuss Innkeeper’s architecture and how — by choosing a reactive stack of technologies — we can stream database records back to the browser. I’ll talk about how (and why) we secured our API using OAuth, and give insights on how we use Docker and the STUPS tools to auto-scale this API on top of AWS. Finally, I’ll describe how we designed a set of unit and integration tests to make sure that our application works correctly, and how we set up our continuous integration environment.</p> <p><br/>About the speaker:  Dan Persa has been a software engineer at Zalando since 2013 and is a member of the Fashion Store team, which is responsible for Zalando’s core ecommerce business. He loves Java and Scala and more recently has been exploring Go and Node.js. He’s a big fan of clean code and software craftsmanship. In addition to coding, he enjoys mentoring new developers, organizing coder dojos and reading groups and giving tech talks. In his free time he likes to take photos and dance salsa.</p> <p>

Discussion 2</p> <p><br/>Title: Cloud Scale Machine Learning with ApacheSpark, MLLIB, Cloudfoundry and OpenStack Swift</p> <p><br/>Speaker: Romeo Kienzler - Chief Data Scientist - IBM Cloud Transformation Lab Zurich</p> <p><br/>Abstract: Clouds provide very cost effective access to computing power and storage. Especially on workloads with high variation on computational and storage resource requirements. Resilient data processing engines like Apache Spark,  a parallel machine learning library on top like MLLIB and elastic storage services like OpenStack Swift are a perfect fit to build a Resilient data processing framework. And this is exactly what IBM has done on the IBM Platform as a Service Cloud called Bluemix. In this session I'll give a very short introduction into all these technologies, open standards and frameworks in order to prepare you for a end - to -end demonstration of a large DNA sequence analysis.</p> <p><br/>About the speaker: Romeo Kienzler holds a Master Degree in Information Systems with specialisation in Applied Statistics and Bioinformatics from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. He works for IBM Zurich as a chief data scientist and architect. His current research focus is on large-scale machine learning on resilient cloud infrastructures based on Apache Spark and Apache Flink on top of Docker Swarm.Romeo Kienzler is a Member of the IBM Academy of Technology, the IBM Technical Expert Council and the IBM BigData BlackBelts team.</p> <p>

Discussion 3</p> <p><br/>Title: The Typesafe Reactive Platform and Apache Spark: Experiences, Challenges and Roadmaps</p> <p><br/>Speaker:  Stavros Kontopoulos, Typesafe</p> <p><br/>Abstract:  In this presentation Stavros Kontopoulos will discuss the role Apache Spark plays for the Typesafe Reactive Platform. He will discuss the Spark team's contribution to the open source project, cover added features like backpressure and dynamic allocation, and describe challenges the team has faced while developing infrastructure for integrated testing. He will also share upcoming roadmap plans, such as:</p> <p><br/>kerberos security, already there for hadoop a must for the enterprise world.</p> <p><br/>Closely examine Tachyon technology.</p> <p><br/>More closely integrate Spark with Typesafe Reactive Platform and our commercial product ConductR</p> <p><br/>About the speaker: Stavros Kontopoulos recently joined the Apache spark team at Typesafe. Prior to Typesafe, Stavros worked in telecoms for several years developing network management products. Immediately before Typesafe he worked as a big-data engineer in the digital marketing sector  for a start-up (Pollfish Inc). Stavros has extensive hands-on experience with web technologies. When not coding he is doing research pursuing a Phd degree with areas of interest being: sublinear algorithms, big data estimators, massive data indexing structures, social network analysis and data structures.</p> ","9000000","1400109744000","14460772","open","52.52000045776367","13.380000114440918","Big Data Developers in Berlin","Big-Data-Developers-in-Berlin","Big Data Enthusiasts","","227744512","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Berlin/events/227744512/","","Apache Spark, Scala, Reactive Technologies and Machine Learning  discussions","","80","","past","1452618000000","1452628541000","3600000","Mollstraße 1","","Berlin","de","24265361","52.526458740234375","Germany","13.415450096130371","Zalando SE","","False","","","public","0","80","Big-Data-Developers-in-Berlin"

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that´s why ""In Silico Medicine"" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.<br/>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.</p> <p>That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.

"6","1424103345000","<p>Is there such a thing as ""unstructured data"" ? As a lot of us have learnt the hard way at school, even natural language has structural rules that must be obeyed.</p> <p>





At this meetup, we will explore the nature &amp; various flavours of unstructured data, the challenges it raises for the developers &amp; data scientist and its importance in the Big Data landscape. First, we will look at the ""semi-structured data"" field with an overview of JSON (one of its major representative), its use &amp; impact on both the relational &amp; NoSQL Big Data worlds, and what it means for the future of the industry and its practitionners. We will then dive into the area of free text, with a developer in the natural language processing field walking us through some of the technical opportunities, challenges &amp; solutions the it has to offer. </p> <p>

Want to know more about unstructured data ? Join us on March 12th at 7:00 PM. </p> <p>

We will need first and last name plus an email address and a company name for security to issue visitor badges. These questions are part of the RSVP, please fill them out before hand to make registration smooth the night of the event. </p> <p>

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:<br/>  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1398108547000","14029592","open","32.29999923706055","-64.79000091552734","Big Data Developers in Bermuda","Big-Data-Developers-in-Bermuda","Big Data Enthusiasts","","223231366","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Bermuda/events/223231366/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428599000","-10800000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","1","Big-Data-Developers-in-Bermuda"

This will be our first Meetup at the IBM office in Cambridge.  </p> <p>Big data projects are challenging for many reasons, from scoping out the business problems to be solved, getting the right skills in place, and showing value to the organization. For this reason, some organizations have avoided the tough conversation around managing risk, including the fundamental conversation around information governance, and how to meet data privacy and data security obligations.  </p> <p>In this meetup, our speakers will discuss some approaches to integrating information governance into typical big data projects that include the use of Hadoop for exploration and analysis. This includes metadata management, data masking while maintaining analytical integrity, and monitoring to detect potential internal/external breaches and for demonstrating compliance to specific audit requirements.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:00pm-7pm: Networking (Food &amp; Beverages provided)</p> <p>7:00pm: Presentation</p> <p>7:45-8pm: Break</p> <p>8pm: Live Demo</p> <p>8:30pm: Networking</p> ","9000000","1374708662000","9505222","open","42.36000061035156","-71.05999755859375","Big Data Developers in Boston","Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston","Members","","184373932","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/184373932/","","Considerations for a Holistic Approach to Big Data Security and Privacy","","60","","past","1402437600000","1402499282000","-14400000","1 Rogers Street","","Cambridge","us","14966082","42.3657341003418","USA","-71.07682037353516","IBM Innovation Center","","False","MA","02142","public","0","58","Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston"

In his current role he is responsible for overseeing WANdisco's product strategy. In his previous role as a founder and chief technology officer (CTO) of Librados, an application integration software provider, Jim was responsible for overall product strategy and product messaging.  He was also a member of the management team that led the company’s acquisition by NetManage, Inc. Following its acquisition, Jim joined NetManage as CTO for the Librados products group. </p> <p>Prior to Librados, he was the vice president of product management for Insevo, a middleware company specializing in enterprise application integration. Jim also held senior product management, product marketing and consulting management positions at BEA Systems and SAP AG.  </p> <p>- <b>Big SQL - Making all of your <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata/"">big data</a> SQL accessible using an optimal execution strategy.  </b>Presenters:<br/><b>Rick Tarro, Jeffrey Carlson - IBM Analytics</b></p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action. </p> <p>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components: </p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss <br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing <br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs. </p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark” </p> <p> Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics. </p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible.

The availability of a rich API has lowered the bar for data scientists by letting them leverage the power of Apache Spark to build machine learning applications without having to write/translate cumbersome Java-based big-data applications. Though the bar to get Apache Spark up and running is low, to fully leverage the power of Spark, applications must be designed and tuned optimally.</p> <p>In this workshop, we will discuss the key tenets of large-scale machine learning and discuss the various algorithms supported by Apache Spark to build statistical and machine learning applications. Through practical case-studies, we will discuss how these algorithms can be applied and scaled to address the big data challenges in the enterprise.</p> <p>Day 1</p> <p>On day one, we will begin with an introduction to Apache Spark. Through examples we will understand how to build applications using PySpark, the Python API for Spark. We will then focus on the MLLib API for building Machine Learning applications in Spark.</p> <p>What you will learn</p> <p>• Apache Spark: An introduction</p> <p>• Considerations for large Scale machine learning: How is it different from running algorithms on your laptop?</p> <p>• Basic Statistical techniques in Apache Spark</p> <p>• Machine Learning Techniques in Apache Spark: Clustering and Classification</p> <p>• Evaluating performance in machine learning algorithms</p> <p>• Case study 1: Clustering large financial assets with Apache Spark</p> <p>• Case study 2: Large Scale regression modeling with Apache Spark</p> <p>Day 2</p> <p>On day two, we will focus on building end-to-end applications with Apache Spark</p> <p>What you will learn</p> <p>• Feature Engineering with Spark: Feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection</p> <p>• Machine Learning Pipelines: Constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines</p> <p>• Deploying Machine Learning models: Tools and Best practices</p> <p>• Case study 3: Processing large datasets with Spark</p> <p>• Case study 4: An end-to-end machine learning application pipeline</p> <p>All applications will be built on the Data Science Experience platform, courtesy of our sponsors</p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/7/5/600_451581365.jpeg"" /></p> ","115200000","1374708662000","9505222","open","42.36000061035156","-71.05999755859375","Big Data Developers in Boston","Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston","Members","","234224624","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/234224624/","","Apache Spark Workshop: Core Statistics and Machine Learning Models","","","","past","1475499600000","1475616425000","-14400000","1 Rogers Street","","Cambridge","us","23817440","42.3664665222168","USA","-71.07735443115234","IBM Client Center","","False","MA","","public","0","33","Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston"
"13","1474467666000","<p>The goal of text classification is the classification of text documents into a fixed number of predefined categories. Text classification has a number of applications ranging from email spam detection to providing news feed content to users based on user preferences.</p> <p>In this session, we will explore how to perform text classification using Spark’s Machine Learning Library (MLlib). We will see how MLlib provides a set of high-level APIs for constructing, evaluating and tuning a machine learning workflow. We will explore how Spark represents a workflow as a pipeline, which consists of a sequence of stages to be run in a specific order. The pipeline for our text classification use case will utilize transformer stages to prepare the raw text documents for classification and estimator stages to learn a machine learning model that can be used to classify documents. Tuning the model for best fit will also be illustrated.</p> <p>In the session, we'll walk through a detailed demo of text classification running in a Spark notebook</p> <p>Although a document classification use case will be specifically explored, many of the principles demonstrated in the session can be employed in a variety of other machine learning use cases.</p> <p>There is no charge of this event.

Structured Streaming allows you to express your streaming computation the same way you would express a computation on static data. This has two benefits. The first is code reuse as essentially the same queries be run on batch, interactive or streaming data. Second, it simplifies streaming application development as you can operate on streams of data just like you can on static data using DataFrames. Structured Streaming abstracts away the complexity of streaming analytics allowing you to perform streaming analytics without having to reason about streaming.</p> <p>The Spark SQL engine takes care of running Structured Streaming queries and incrementally and continuously updating the result as streaming data continues to arrive. With Spark Structured Streaming, you can express streaming aggregations, event-time windows, as well as join streaming data to static data.</p> <p>In this session, we’ll walk through the basics of Structured Streaming, its programming model and APIs.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

We will see how MLlib provides a set of high-level APIs for constructing, evaluating and tuning a machine learning workflow. We will explore how Spark represents a workflow as a Pipeline, which consists of a sequence of stages to be run in a specific order. The Pipeline for our text classification use case will utilize Transformer stages to prepare the raw text documents for classification and Estimator stages to learn a machine learning model that can be used to classify documents.

In Spark, the querying is done in-memory where real-time or archived data can provide faster time-to-value results. Spark was designed to provide from 10 to 100 times faster performance for specific applications. It complements Hadoop’s capabilities by providing a unified platform for storing and analyzing the data in a single environment.</p> <p><br/>It offers an integral view and opportunity to gain valuable insights by analyzing large volumes of structured and unstructured data. The main benefit is the capability to deliver these real-time insights based on a simplified software development process - creating and running algorithms to extract value from a wide range of data sets. Apache Spark is the platform for creating and running such algorithms.</p> <p><br/>This session is a technical discussion so all big data architects, developers, technical personnel, etc. are welcome to attend.</p> <p><br/>Please join us Wednesday, October 7 2015 for a virtual discussion (details to follow) of Apache Spark to learn more about this newer technology and the advantages gained when data scientists can build models quickly and run iterative jobs on distributed data sets.

"2","1462985528000","<p>Apache Spark is an open source big data processing framework built around speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. First developed in 2009, Spark provides several advantages over other big data and MapReduce technologies. With Spark, Hadoop clusters can run up to 100 times faster in memory, and 10 times faster when running on disk. With the ability to write applications in Java, Scala or even Python, Spark is a flexible and power paradigm.</p> <p>With IBM's ""Open for Data"" cloud computing initiative, current and prospective users can provision an instance of Spark in the cloud in a matter of minutes without up-front infrastructure investment. The power of the cloud empowers users to scale up massively based on business needs. De-provisioning resources when those needs change is equally as agile, giving our users the best value for performance.<br/>Please join us on Tuesday June 14th, 2016 at 12:00 noon as we discuss Spark both deployed as a service and on premise. After an introduction to Spark, we'll talk about how to decide if your project is well suited for processing in the cloud. Finally we'll perform a brief demonstration.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

"41","1465397218000","<p>Apache <b>Spark </b>is an <b>open source </b>big data processing framework built around speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. First developed in 2009, Spark provides several advantages over other big data and MapReduce technologies. With Spark, Hadoop clusters can run up to 100 times faster in memory, and 10 times faster when running on disk. With the ability to write applications in Java, Scala or even Python, Spark is a flexible and powerful paradigm.</p> <p>With IBM's ""Open for Data"" cloud computing initiative, current and prospective users can provision an instance of Spark in the cloud in a matter of minutes without up-front infrastructure investment. The power of the cloud empowers users to scale up massively based on business needs. De-provisioning resources when those needs change is equally as agile, giving our users the best value for performance.</p> <p><br/>Please join us on <b>Tuesday</b>,<b> June 28</b>, 2016 at <b>12:00</b> noon as we discuss Spark both deployed as a service and on premise. After an introduction to Spark, we'll talk about how to decide if your project is well suited for processing in the cloud. Finally we'll perform a brief demonstration. Food and beverages will be provided. Seats are limited, so sign up today!</p> <p>Presenter: Andrew Levine</p> ","","1397076013000","13827012","open","35.77000045776367","-78.63999938964844","Big Data Developers in Raleigh","Big-Data-Developers-in-Raleigh","Members","","231744087","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Raleigh/events/231744087/","","Introduction to Spark In-memory Computing","","","","past","1467129600000","1467339769000","-14400000","3039 E Cornwallis Rd","","Durham","us","24552431","35.90505599975586","USA","-78.85645294189453","IBM RTP - Technical Exploration Center","","False","NC","","public","0","72","Big-Data-Developers-in-Raleigh"

You can issue JDBC queries or ODBC queries to access data that is stored in InfoSphere BigInsights, in the same way that you access databases from your enterprise applications.</p> <p><br/>You can use Big SQL to issue queries of any size, including concurrent queries. Big SQL provides support for large ad-hoc queries by using MapReduce parallelism and point queries, which are low-latency queries that return information quickly to reduce response time and provide improved access to data.  </p> <p>


HBase is a column-oriented database management system that runs on top of HDFS. It is well suited for sparse data sets, which are common in many big data use cases. Unlike relational database systems, HBase does not support a structured query language like SQL; in fact, HBase isn’t a relational data store at all.  HBase applications are typically written in Java much like a MapReduce application or in other languages by using Apache Thrift.  However, HBase can be queried with SQL when combined with Hive and or Big SQL!</p> <p>


Apache Accumulo, like HBase, derives from Google's BigTable technology.  While the two technologies are similar in architecture, Accumulo excels in security right down to the cell level.  Attendees will receive an introduction to Apache Accumulo and hear about IBM's Accumulo research project.</p> <p>

<b>Join us from 11:00am - 6:00pm on February the 4th to learn about Big SQL, Hive and HBase. Register at: <a href=""http://ibm.co/19APszk""><a href=""http://ibm.co/19APszk"" class=""linkified"">http://ibm.co/19APszk</a></a></b></p> <p>

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:<br/>  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1351195109000","5560562","open","38.90999984741211","-77.02999877929688","Big Data Developers in DC","Big-Data-Developers-in-DC","Developers","","223231122","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-DC/events/223231122/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428598000","-14400000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","39","Big-Data-Developers-in-DC"

"8","1460581152000","<p>The rise of NoSQL databases has changed the way we think about storing data. For years, on-premise relational databases have been the standard method of data storage across the IT industry. Some applications, however, have benefited greatly by making the shift to a NoSQL data store. Rising to prominence in the mid-2000's, NoSQL gained a solid traction with the boom in mobile technology. Today NoSQL databases are a critical element of countless traditional, mobile, and Internet of Things applications.</p> <p>With IBM's ""Open for Data"" cloud computing initiative, current and prospective users can provision a NoSQL database in a matter of minutes without a hefty up-front infrastructure investment.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:</p> <p>•  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1364206095000","7770862","open","19.43000030517578","-99.13999938964844","Big Data Developers in Mexico City","Big-Data-Developers-in-Mexico-City","Developers","","223230472","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Mexico-City/events/223230472/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data and design (Web Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428597000","-18000000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","31","Big-Data-Developers-in-Mexico-City"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets.

<b>Biography of the speaker (in his own words):</b></p> <p>

Michael Moorhouse<br/>I’m a Bioinformatician – a mixture of Biology, computer science and mathematics. My undergraduate degree is in ‘Biochemistry’ and having started programming computers aged eight I did my Masters degree in Bioinformatics because the overlap of the fields interested me. I’ve worked in the Netherlands, my home country of the UK and in Canada on a range of topics in the field of Bioscience and medical research for the past few years. Most of these involved ‘data munging’ to interface pre-existing tools and packages to my own software or filtering strategies. Quite quickly I became interested in Data Management: better management = less munging &amp; better results with less pain. I have spent a lot of my time more recently assisting with the storage, transfer and security of the newer ‘Genomics’ data – specifically resulting from High Throughput DNA Sequencing - between international databases or consortia. My current roll is that of ‘Automation Engineer’ – aka. ‘Data Manager’ – at the OICR. Here I and the team are responsible safe and secure keeping of ~2 PB of data with a typical data set being in the ~20-50TB range</p> ","","1374711411000","9505562","open","43.65999984741211","-79.4000015258789","Big Data Developers in Toronto","Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto","Members","","220304792","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto/events/220304792/","","Managing & Processing Big Data for Cancer Genomics, an insight of Bioinformatics","","","","past","1423782000000","1424206308000","-18000000","120 Bloor Street East","","Toronto","ca","19046962","43.67129898071289","Canada","-79.38381958007812","IBM Centre for Solution Innovation","","False","ON","","public","0","74","Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto"

"2","1425318634000","<p>This meetup has been set up in support of our friends at IEEE Toronto. Two topics will be covered:</p> <p><b>Topic 1: </b><br/>Semi-automated human genome annotation</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b><br/>Sequence census methods like ChIP-seq now produce an unprecedented amount of genome-anchored data. We have developed an integrative method to identify patterns from multiple experiments simultaneously while taking full advantage of high-resolution data, discovering joint patterns across different assay types. We apply this method to ENCODE chromatin data for multiple human cell types, including ChIP-seq data on covalent histone modifications and transcription factor binding, and DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq readouts of open chromatin. In an unsupervised fashion, we identify patterns associated with transcription start sites, gene ends, enhancers, CTCF elements, and repressed regions. The method yields a model which elucidates the relationship between assay observations and functional elements in the genome. This model identifies sequences likely to affect transcription, and we verify these predictions in laboratory experiments. We have made software and an integrative genome browser track freely available (<a href=""http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/""><a href=""http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/"" class=""linkified"">http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/</a></a>).</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><br/>Michael M. Hoffman (Assistant Professor in the Departments of Medical Biophysics and Computer Science, University of Toronto)</p> <p><b>Topic #2: </b><br/>Deep Autoencoder Neural Networks for Gene Ontology Annotation Predictions</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b><br/>The annotation of genomic information is a major challenge in biology and bioinformatics. Existing databases of known gene functions are incomplete and prone to errors, and the biomolecular experiments needed to improve these databases are slow and costly. While computational methods are not a substitute for experimental verification, they can help in two ways: algorithms can aid in the curation of gene annotations by automatically suggesting inaccuracies, and they can predict previously-unidentified gene functions, accelerating the rate of gene function discovery. In this work, we develop an algorithm that achieves both goals using deep autoencoder neural networks. With experiments on gene annotation data from the Gene Ontology project, we show that deep autoencoder networks achieve better performance than other standard machine learning methods, including the popular truncated singular value decomposition.</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><br/>Davide Chicco (postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto)</p> ","","1374711411000","9505562","open","43.65999984741211","-79.4000015258789","Big Data Developers in Toronto","Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto","Members","","220871450","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto/events/220871450/","","Semi-automated human genome annotation","","","","past","1425934800000","1426010849000","-14400000","101 College Street ","","Toronto","ca","23640357","43.6598014831543","Canada","-79.38874816894531","Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Medical Discovery Tower, 4th floor, room 4-204","","False","ON","","public","0","35","Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto"

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:</p> <p>•  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","92700000","1368600910000","8493752","open","39.9900016784668","-83.04000091552734","Big Data Developers in Columbus","Big-Data-Developers-in-Columbus","Developers","","223230024","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Columbus/events/223230024/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only))","","","","past","1434420000000","1434513724000","-14400000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","20","Big-Data-Developers-in-Columbus"

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

"3","1408633656000","<p>                                      Join us for our BI &amp; Analytics Kickoff Party!  </p> <p>Zain Khandwala, the founding executive director of the Institute for Advanced Analytics at Bellarmine University will share with us Bellarmine's vision for Data Science.</p> <p><img src=""http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/9/8/600_405334712.jpeg"" /></p> <p>“There have been a number of fields and sub-disciplines around the better use of data to help businesses do those things,” he said. “Operations research, marketing research, managerial science, actuarial science – these are all inherently quantitative disciplines that served business well for a number of decades.”</p> <p><br/>But what ended up happening was the “datafication” of the world, said Mr. Khandwala. “More automated processes, enhanced technologies, our increasing capacity to store data and the development of the web” led to a data revolution. “As a result, organizations are looking at their data assets, their data warehouses, and trying to better understand how to leverage it – to answer some of the questions we felt were unanswerable in the past,” he said.</p> <p>&lt;a href=""http://www.bellarminemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Zain.jpg""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This new way of thinking about data isn’t just about volume, storage or retrieval; it’s also about timeliness and what Mr. Khandwala calls holistic thinking. “In the past, you might meet to make decisions based on a report from a month ago. Now data is at your fingertips, it’s being produced and collated in real time and accessible – if only we have the wherewithal and talent to leverage it,” he said.</p> <p>To help prepare a new generation of data decision-makers, the Institute is launching a Master of Science in Analytics (MSA) degree this fall. Future plans include cross-disciplinary analytics coursework, certification programs, corporate training, and research and consulting services. Mr. Khandwala will hire faculty and staff, but the Institute will also benefit from the wealth of faculty talent in other disciplines at Bellarmine.</p> <p>The MSA program is an intensive 10-month, full-time, STEM master’s degree, focusing on business and organizations (as opposed to scientific and engineering data analysis). The program is modeled on a pioneering degree at North Carolina State University, where Mr. Khandwala earned his MSA. (He also holds an MBA in management science and marketing from the University of Toronto and a BS in computer science from the University of British Columbia.)</p> <p>A native of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, he attended high school in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Before coming to Bellarmine, he was a researcher and lecturer for various education programs and, most recently, an analytics recruiter for J.P. Morgan Chase.</p> <p>He hopes to enroll 20 students for the first-year program at Bellarmine and escalate to 40 students within three years. Students will come from Louisville, of course, but he will also recruit regionally and nationally and establish industry partnerships.</p> <p>Indications are that there is a huge demand. Conjecturally, almost any organization can make better use of digital data. “Banks, insurance companies and telcos [telecommunications companies] were quickest to datafy their world,” said Mr. Khandwala. Louisville’s major corporations have substantial and exponentially growing data challenges and opportunities.</p> <p>But small organizations, governments and nonprofits can also make use of better analytics. “The Gartner Report says that by 2018 there will be a shortage of 200,000 to 400,000 analytics professionals or data-savvy professionals across the country,” he said. So it’s not just big business that stands to gain. “A lot of charitable organizations with limited resources use analytics to figure out who they’re likely to get the fastest and best response from,” he said.</p> <p>And analytics, much like the PC, Internet and smartphone revolutions that preceded and helped spawn it, even comes with its own rock stars. “President Obama’s re-election campaign was a celebrated use of analytics – the data scientists who worked on that campaign were very savvy people. They are celebrities in our community now,” said Mr. Khandwala.</p> <p>So, who are these future data rock stars? “A lot of our candidates will come straight out of undergrad,” said Mr. Khandwala. “People with quantitative aptitude, quantitative training and business understanding. There will also be a lot of career changers – people who recognize that this is the hot new space. There are organizations clamoring for the position and paying very well for it. And a lot are people who are already doing data work – business intelligence, producing reports, telling stories with data – but who want to elevate their skill sets.”</p> <p>One way Bellarmine will do that is by teaching what Mr. Khandwala calls the “art and culture” of analytics. “You could approach data science or analytics in a purely scientific way,” he said. “You could say, ‘Here’s how you run certain models; here’s how you extract data; here’s how you write the SQL code; here’s how you get outputs.’ That’s the science behind analytics.</p> <p>“To me, the art behind analytics is equally important. It is working with the business partners and the other stakeholders in an organization. It’s helping them understand what the organizational needs are, what the challenges are, what business problems they face and working with them to figure out what the priorities should be. How can we better manage our data assets? Which of these problems are most solvable using the data?</p> <p>“That’s the art of analytics. The culture of analytics is an organizational thing. How do we become more data inquisitive? How do we get to a place where all of our conversations can be data-driven? How do we go from thinking deterministically to probabilistically? How do you create a culture where an organization is continually learning about itself from data?”</p> <p>One way students will think deeply about the art and culture of analytics is through intensive, eight-week internships at local organizations. This is a part of the program that benefits the students, benefits the businesses or organizations, and is a foundational concept behind creating an institute and not simply a new master’s degree. “I have no doubt that we can create experiences that are valuable for the student – working with real data in a real-world situation – but also create substantive value for the organizations,” said Mr. Khandwala.</p> <p>“One advantage we have as an institute is to help advance the use of analytics within our organization itself. After the internship, we can bring the students back in to work for a couple of months on a capstone project that is in service to the university.”</p> <p>Another discipline in keeping with Bellarmine’s values is the incorporation of ethics into the program. There are infamous examples of ethical lapses in the era of digital data, from derivatives shenanigans to high-frequency trading, to government spying, to creepy examples like a famous 2012 incident involving Target. The retailer got in hot water by using its data to correctly identify a high school girl as being pregnant – and sending her coupons for maternity clothes and baby products – before she had even told her family.</p> <p>“There are hard questions, not just about security and privacy – those are germane and beginning to be well understood – but there are questions that go beyond that: What does it mean to target ethically? How do you incorporate social justice? How do you differentiate without prejudicing? Ethics will be a component of what we’re calling ‘analytical leadership,’ ” he said.</p> <p>“There are three foundational courses of the program: Analytical Leadership, the Analytical Organization and Foundations to Analytical Thought. This is where we involve the liberal arts – how do you think analytically, how do you think creatively, what is the right application of logic and the quantitative sciences – to arrive at what we might loosely call truths.”</p> <p>If that all sounds like a complex turn around the dance floor, consider Mr. Khandwala’s hobby: He’s a Latin dancer. Once a competitive dancer and a teacher of salsa and merengue dancing, he now dances socially. “I’ve found that Louisville has a great community for it. Thursday nights at Sky Bar above Saints in St. Matthews – it’s the big night for dancing here!” he said. “I’m also going to be the faculty sponsor for a Latin-dance club here on campus. That’s a big passion of mine.”</p> ","7200000","1408631611000","16526912","open","38.2599983215332","-85.75","Louisville Business Intelligence & Big Data Analytics Meetup","Louisville-BI-Big-Data-Analytics-Meetup","Members","Library Room B24","202307712","https://www.meetup.com/Louisville-BI-Big-Data-Analytics-Meetup/events/202307712/","","Louisville BI & Big Data Analytics KickOff!","","30","","past","1411682400000","1412015827000","-14400000","2001 Newburg Road","","Louisville","us","9095122","38.220733642578125","USA","-85.70416259765625","Bellarmine University","","False","KY","40205","public","0","15","Louisville-BI-Big-Data-Analytics-Meetup"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine?

Presenter: Benjamin Lumbert, Big Data Systems Engineer, IBM </b><br/>  </p> <p><b>Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud</b></p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action.</p> <p><br/>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:</p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss<br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing<br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.</p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark” </p> <p><br/><b>BigSQL 4.1. </b> Presenter: Benjamin Lumbert, Big Data Systems Engineer, IBM</p> <p> Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.</p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources. </p> <p><b>Parking</b></p> <p>-  On-site valet $8 per car</p> ","10800000","1355849621000","6285502","open","41.880001068115234","-87.63999938964844","Big Data Developers in Chicago","Big-Data-Developers-in-Chicago","Developers","Zip: 60607","226883184","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Chicago/events/226883184/","","Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud","","","","past","1452727800000","1452739866000","-21600000","950 W.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

Spark is recognized as a great analytics engine. One of its benefits is its inclusion of machine learning algorithms that can group, predict, classify and even recommend based on the analysis of a corpus of data. Once the model is created, it can be applied to new data. In some situations, there is a need to score the model while the data is streaming to decide what to do with the new data.</p> <p>In this latest Data Science Central Webinar event, you will learn how to process the data to arrive at a model and how the resulting model can be used to score streaming data using IBM Streams.</p> <p><br/><b>Register Online Here:   <a href=""http://bit.ly/2o4YZag""><a href=""http://bit.ly/2o4YZag"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2o4YZag</a></a></b></p> ","","1435781750000","18712651","open","32.790000915527344","-96.80000305175781","Dallas Streams","Dallas-Streams","Streamers","Register Online and Secure Your Spot!","238618818","https://www.meetup.com/Dallas-Streams/events/238618818/","","Apache Spark and IBM Streams Working Together in Streaming Analytics","","","","past","1490716800000","1490728898000","-18000000","http://bit.ly/2o4YZag","","Dallas","us","25124766","0.0","USA","0.0","Live Webinar","","False","TX","","public","0","13","Dallas-Streams"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:</p> <p>•  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1374704306000","9504442","open","32.959999084472656","-96.9800033569336","Big Data Developers in Dallas","Big-Data-Developers-in-Dallas","Members","","223230903","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Dallas/events/223230903/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data and design (Web Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434431217000","-18000000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","39","Big-Data-Developers-in-Dallas"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

"19","1377275042000","<p>Streaming data is all around us – from social media feeds to call data records – but can be difficult to leverage. Sometimes there is simply too much data to collect and store before analyzing it. Sometimes it’s an issue of timing – by the time they store data on disk, analyze it, and respond – it’s too late. Organizations need a way to harness the natural resource of streaming data and turn it into actionable insight. Enter stream computing.</p> <p><br/>Stream computing changes where, when and how much of your business data you can analyze. By extracting insight from data as it is streaming, you can react to events as they are happening to reshape business outcomes. Store less, analyze more, and make better decisions, faster. From increased customer retention to earlier fraud detection to more frequent cross-selling, the benefits of stream computing are many. </p> <p>______________________</p> <p>Here is a <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/photos/15184542/"">map </a>&lt;a href=""http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/3/8/global_274034392.jpeg""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;to the meeting location.</p> <p><br/>Enter the building from the ground floor lobby and use the south elevator bank to go to the 5th floor.</p> <p><b>Please note</b> - the doors close at 6:00 pm.

"2","1393973396000","<p>In last month's discussion, we discussed STREAMS and the use of Annotator Query Language (AQL) and other tools to analyze real time data.</p> <p>Come learn how to boost your Text Analytics productivity and capabilities with AQL!! </p> <p>This session we will discuss<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/kf7owtt"">AQL</a>, a query language designed for Text Analytics which provides analysts and programmers a set of SQL-like expressions so it’s immediately familiar, making it easier to learn and develop. The engine was developed by IBM research. IBM has been working in this area for many years and regularly work with customers to extend and enhance its capabilities.</p> <p>Why and What is Text Analytics?</p> <p>Text Analytics is a way to extract information from unstructured and semi-structured documents. By extracting information from these documents, you can combine it with other more traditional structured information to get a more complete view of your business, your customers and your competitors. Most text documents are written by people to convey information to other people so they don't follow strict rules controlling content, layout and style. As a result, you can't use traditional ETL tools to extract information from them. Call center records are a good example. They often include fields containing the text of a dialog with a customer and notes and comments made by the call center rep. There's lots of valuable information in these fields, but you can't extract it using ETL tools. The same is true for social media and sentiment data. These new data sources contain huge amounts of very valuable information about your business, your customers and your competitors, but if you want to extract meaningful information from data from blogs, tweets, call center records and other unstructured documents you need Text Analytics.</p> <p>Using Text Analytics we can make it easier to intelligently search and access information from these documents and we can open up the information to traditional Business Intelligence and warehousing tools and technologies. Machines are very good at quickly applying unambiguous rules that can be precisely encoded; but processing documents using rule based or grammar based extraction techniques doesn’t work very well; there's just too much variability and these systems usually become ‘brittle’. IBM Text Analytics is based on a system that lets you identify elements of interest and their context without writing complex and fragile grammars and rules. Think of the way you scan a document, identifying information of interest, determining the context and then extracting the information you need. IBM Text Analytics uses a similar machine based model.</p> ","","1366111606000","8089392","open","33.5099983215332","-112.06999969482422","Big Data Developers in Phoenix","Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix","Developers and Architects","","169436992","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/events/169436992/","","AQL - Annotator Query Language","","","","past","1395279000000","1395290021000","-25200000","8070 E Morgan Trail, Suite 130","","Phoenix","us","17847932","33.57707977294922","USA","-111.90768432617188","QCM Technologies Center for Innovation ","","False","AZ","","public","0","27","Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix"

From such diverse sources as social media feeds, Call Detail Records (CDRs), consumer transactions, financial markets, machine sensors, etc., streaming data is present in virtually every modern business process and social interaction. However, the sheer speed and volume of this data type makes it difficult to leverage using conventional systems.</p> <p>Typically, there is too much data to collect, store, and analyze in a timely fashion. By the time data is stored on disk and analyzed, the response is no longer relevant. Organizations need a system that captures the value of streaming data in near-real-time and transforms it into actionable insight. – Enter IBM InfoSphere® Streams.</p> <p>Streams processing is a new computing model that affects the “when,” “where,” and “how” of enterprise data analysis. By processing data as soon as it is captured, the enterprise can react rapidly to events as they occur, resulting in optimized business outcomes. From increased customer retention; to earlier fraud detection; to more productive cross-selling, the benefits of streams processing are many. IBM InfoSphere Streams uses innovative technology to perform rapid real-time analysis of information originating from a myriad of disparate sources resulting in positive outcomes for the enterprise. This Meet-Up session introduces participants to the capabilities of the IBM InfoSphere® Streams platform.

While NoSQL offers<br/>dynamic elasticity with data and its organization, these databases lack essential<br/>elements common to enterprise class databases. Today, IBM offers a solution that can natively handle NoSQL and structured data simultaneously giving you the flexibility and development speed of NoSQL with all the features and<br/>characteristics of an enterprise class database.</p> <p>This roadshow will help you understand how application developers can use full<br/>NoSQL functionality (including sharding) for complete plug-and-play compatibility with MongoDB and graph-store databases. They can access structured and unstructured data in a single statement and join them together as needed. These applications can use the enterprise-level capabilities of a structured database system including transaction support, backup and recovery, H/A, compression, enhanced scalability, security and access control. IBM's solution also enables the execution of comprehensive analytics using Cognos or other BI tools on NoSQL data in IBM's market-leading in-memory data warehouse acceleration technology, commonly referred to as BLU.</p> <p><b>To register for the event, go to the IBM Internet of Things / NoSQL Events page at: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/m6zw5sd""><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/m6zw5sd"" class=""linkified"">http://tinyurl.com/m6zw5sd</a></a></b></p> ","28800000","1366111606000","8089392","open","33.5099983215332","-112.06999969482422","Big Data Developers in Phoenix","Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix","Developers and Architects","Park in garage @ 3rd Street & Catalina (fee required)","183935662","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/events/183935662/","","Developer's Workshop: NoSQL functionality (including sharding)","PT88H","15","","past","1401811200000","1402979665000","-25200000","2929 N Central Ave","","Phoenix","us","13477442","33.481689453125","USA","-112.07311248779297","IBM Office, Room 540 (5th Floor)","","False","AZ","85012","public","0","14","Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix"

For interactive queries that require a few seconds (or even milliseconds) of response time, MapReduce (MR) is the wrong choice. On the other hand, for queries that require massive scale and runtime fault tolerance, an MR framework works well. MR was built for large-scale processing on big data, viewed mostly as “batch” processing.</p> <p><br/>As enterprises start using Apache Hadoop as a central data repository for all data — originating from sources as varied as operational systems, sensors, smart devices, metadata and internal applications — SQL processing becomes an optimal choice. A fundamental reason is that most enterprise data management and analytical tools rely on SQL.</p> <p><br/>As a tool for interactive query execution, SQL processing (of relational data) benefits from decades of research, usage experience and optimizations. Clearly, the SQL skills pool far exceeds that of MR developers and data scientists. As a general-purpose processing framework, MR may still be appropriate for ad hoc analytics, but that is as far as it can go with current technology.</p> ","","1366111606000","8089392","open","33.5099983215332","-112.06999969482422","Big Data Developers in Phoenix","Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix","Developers and Architects","","187561372","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/events/187561372/","","Leverage what you already know with - SQL on Hadoop","","","","past","1403141400000","1403213402000","-25200000","8070 E Morgan Trail, Suite 130","","Scottsdale","us","17847902","33.57707977294922","USA","-111.90768432617188","QCM Technologies Center for Innovation","","False","AZ","","public","0","38","Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix"

"9","1439914753000","<p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Implementing solutions with Apache Hadoop requires understanding not just Hadoop, but a broad range of related projects in the Hadoop ecosystem such as Hive, Pig, Oozie, Sqoop, and Flume. The good news is that there’s an abundance of materials – books, web sites, conferences, etc. – for gaining a deep understanding of Hadoop and these related projects. The bad news is there’s still a scarcity of information on how to integrate these components to implement complete solutions. In this tutorial we’ll walk through an end-to-end case study of a clickstream analytics engine to provide a concrete example of how to architect and implement a complete solution with Hadoop. We’ll use this example to illustrate important topics such as:</p> <p>• Modeling data in Hadoop and selecting optimal storage formats for data stored in Hadoop</p> <p>• Moving data between Hadoop and external data management systems such as relational databases</p> <p>• Moving event-based data such as logs and machine generated data into Hadoop</p> <p>• Accessing and processing data in Hadoop</p> <p>• Orchestrating and scheduling workflows on Hadoop</p> <p>Throughout the example, best practices and considerations for architecting applications on Hadoop will be covered. This talk will be valuable for developers, architects, or project leads who are already knowledgeable about Hadoop, and are now looking for more insight into how it can be leveraged to implement real-world applications.</p> <p><b>Biography:</b></p> <p>Mark Grover is a co-author of O'Reilly Hadoop Application Architectures. He is also a committer on Apache Bigtop, a committer and PMC member on Apache Sentry (incubating) and a contributor to</p> <p>Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache Sqoop, Apache Pig and Apache Flume. He is a section author of O’Reilly’s book on Apache Hive – Programming Hive.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:</p> <p>•  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1374710045000","9505412","open","33.970001220703125","-118.23999786376953","Big Data Developers in Los Angeles","Big-Data-Developers-in-Los-Angeles","Members","","223230156","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Los-Angeles/events/223230156/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428597000","-25200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","31","Big-Data-Developers-in-Los-Angeles"

The Spark Summit in last year had only about 500 attendees, for this year, the summit had more than 2000 attendees with many good use cases presented. More info about this summit is available at <a href=""https://spark-summit.org/2015/""><a href=""https://spark-summit.org/2015/"" class=""linkified"">https://spark-summit.org/2015/</a></a> .</p> <p>The Chief Information Officer from the Central Intelligence Agency, Doug Wolfe, also spoke at the Spark summit, about open data and about adopting big data technologies in government. It seems Spark could be very useful to process all the open data available, and I was told some venture capital funds have been created specially for the open data and public sector analytics, with the $100 Million SineWave Venture Fund as one example.</p> <p>And as announced at the Spark summit, IBM made a huge commitment to Spark, with a Spark Technology Center to be established in San Francisco that IBM will put thousands of data scientists and researchers into Spark development and has already made the IBM machine learning package, SystemML, open source to be integrated into Spark.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:<br/>  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1381287133000","10613262","open","36.09000015258789","-115.13999938964844","Big Data Developers in Las Vegas","big-data-developers-in-las-vegas","Members","","223231323","https://www.meetup.com/big-data-developers-in-las-vegas/events/223231323/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only))","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428599000","-25200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","6","big-data-developers-in-las-vegas"

We'll provide food, drinks, and record for viewing later if you register for the event we'll email you think link after.</p> <p>Abstract<br/>Storm has long served as the main platform for real-time analytics at Twitter. However, as the scale of data being processed in real- time at Twitter has increased, along with an increase in the diversity and the number of use cases, many limitations of Storm have become apparent. We need a system that scales better, has better debug-ability, has better performance, and is easier to manage – all while working in a shared cluster infrastructure. We considered various alternatives to meet these needs, and in the end concluded that we needed to build a new real-time stream data processing system. This talk will present the design and implementation of the new system, called Heron. Heron is now the de facto stream data processing engine inside Twitter, and we share our experiences from running Heron in production.</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Karthik is the engineering manager and technical lead for Real Time Analytics at Twitter. He has two decades of experience working in parallel databases, big data infrastructure and networking. He cofounded Locomatix, a company that specializes in real time streaming processing on Hadoop and Cassandra using SQL that was acquired by Twitter. Before Locomatix, he had a brief stint with Greenplum where he worked on parallel query scheduling. Greenplum was eventually acquired by EMC for more than $300M. Prior to Greenplum, Karthik was at Juniper Networks where he designed and delivered platforms, protocols, databases and high availability solutions for network routers that are widely deployed in the Internet. Before joining Juniper at University of Wisconsin, he worked extensively in parallel database systems, query processing, scale out technologies, storage engine and online analytical systems. Several of these research were spun as a company later acquired by Teradata.</p> <p>He is the author of several publications, patents and one of the best selling book ""Network Routing: Algorithms, Protocols and Architectures.""

(location is tentative and subject to change)</p> <p>---------------------------</p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative. Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.</p> <p>Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.</p> ","9900000","1398141265000","14038802","open","49.279998779296875","-123.12000274658203","Big Data Developers in Vancouver","Big-Data-Developers-in-Vancouver","Big Data Enthusiasts","","223061513","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Vancouver/events/223061513/","","Spark Party - 5 minute Lightning sessions...","","","","past","1434416400000","1434476304000","-25200000","4611 Canada Way","","Burnaby","ca","1632935","49.255531311035156","Canada","-122.99494934082031","IBM Office","","False","BC","","public","0","70","Big-Data-Developers-in-Vancouver"

"0","1490199064000","<p>Greetings Streamers !! </p> <p>Spark is recognized as a great analytics engine. One of its benefits is its inclusion of machine learning algorithms that can group, predict, classify and even recommend based on the analysis of a corpus of data. Once the model is created, it can be applied to new data. In some situations, there is a need to score the model while the data is streaming to decide what to do with the new data.</p> <p>In this latest Data Science Central Webinar event, you will learn how to process the data to arrive at a model and how the resulting model can be used to score streaming data using IBM Streams.</p> <p><br/><b>Register Online Here:  <a href=""http://bit.ly/2o4YZag""><a href=""http://bit.ly/2o4YZag"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2o4YZag</a></a></b></p> ","3600000","1435841329000","18714101","open","47.61000061035156","-122.33000183105469","Seattle Streams","Seattle-Streams","Streamers","Live Webinar is PST.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW. </p> <p><br/>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.</p> <p><br/>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.</p> <p>That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value. On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

He is one of the top committers in the open source community of Tachyon project. Prior to Tachyon Nexus, he worked in Google to build the next-generation storage infrastructure and won Google's Technical Infrastructure award.  Bin had publication in most prestigious acadmic conferences in Computer Science including SIGCOMM, SOSP, NSDI, and got his PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University</p> <p>Title: Introduction to Memory-centric Distributed Storage System Tachyon and Its Use Case</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Memory is the key to fast Big Data processing. This has been realized by many, and frameworks such as Spark and Shark already leverage memory performance. As data sets continue to grow, storage is increasingly becoming a critical bottleneck in many workloads.</p> <p>To address this need, we have developed Tachyon, a memory centric fault-tolerant distributed file system, which enables reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce. Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Different from traditional replication scheme, Tachyon achieves fault-tolerance by leveraging lineage information.</p> <p>Over two years of research and production deployment, Tachyon as an open-source system has more than 160 contributors from over 50 institutions, including IBM, Yahoo, Intel, Redhat, Baidu, and Tachyon Nexus. We had a major release, version 0.8 in October 2015, including numerous new features. In particular, the latest version support mounting of multiple under storage systems and transparent naming enables more exciting use cases for Tachyon users,  remote write to allow users to write to Tachyon through remote workers, detailed monitoring of the master and workers, and integration with Yarn and Mesos. In the presentation, we will also explore several potential industry use cases enabled by the new features. </p> <p>============= </p> <p>Speaker:  <b>Kostas Sakellis</b> is a Software Engineer and contributor to Apache Spark. Previous to that, he contributed to the extensibility effort on Cloudera Manager. Before Cloudera, Kostas did a 6 year stint at Amazon working across various teams including platform infrastructure. Kostas has a Bachelors of Mathematics in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo.</p> <p><br/>Title: Apache Spark 101: Taming Big Data</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Apache Spark has become a very popular data processing framework due to its speed and easy of use. In this talk we will start at the beginning and give a brief technical introduction to key Spark concepts and differentiators. We will dive deep into the core architecture of Spark and discuss improvements over MapReduce. We will conclude with a few examples of Spark being used to solve real world problems. </p> <p>=============</p> ","","1391781826000","12764782","open","1.2999999523162842","103.8499984741211","Big Data Developers in Singapore","Big-Data-Developers-in-Singapore","Members","Room 321/322","226995364","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Singapore/events/226995364/","","December Meetup during Strata!","","","","past","1448965800000","1448984089000","28800000","#1 Raffles Blvd","","Suntec City","sg","24226661","1.3520829677581787","Singapore","103.81983947753906","Suntec Convention & Exhibition Center","","False","","","public","0","71","Big-Data-Developers-in-Singapore"

The big data community has been making great strides in recent years to secure Hadoop clusters where all aspects of security are now covered—authentication, authorization, encryption of data-in-transit, encryption of data-at-rest, and centralized auditing. At the same time, many challenges are still facing cluster administrators who are responsible for setting up security, and developers who are charged with integrating new services into existing secure clusters.  In this talk, we’ll cover basic concepts that form the foundation of big data security such as Kerberos/SPNEGO, impersonation, TLS and encryption key management. We’ll discuss challenges we’ve had in deploying the Hadoop clusters in real-world scenarios and lessons learned when integrating new components/services into secure clusters.</p> <p><b><i>Presenter: Richard Ding, IBM</i></b><br/>Richard Ding is big data architect for IBM, who is responsible for the security aspects of IBM Open Platform and IBM BigInsights, IBM’s 100% open source Hadoop distribution. Over the past years, he has been working with customers to setup secure Spark/Hadoop clusters and helping developers to integrate new services into secure clusters.</p> <p><b>Part </b><b>II</b><b>: </b><b>Disaster </b><b>Recovery</b><b> on Hadoop</b></p> <p>As organizations’ maturity levels around big data technologies increase, we’re seeing a rise in the use of Apache Hadoop as a component of business-critical systems which raises new risks from an IT management perspective. They need the same kind of protection as any other tier-one system, in terms of high availability and disaster recovery capabilities. In this meetup we will focus on different replication strategies that can be leveraged based on RTO and RPO requirements and their pro's and cons.</p> <p><b><i>Presenter:  Vinayak Agrawal, IBM</i></b><br/>Vinayak (Vin) Agrawal is the Product Manager for Big Replicate at IBM. He started his career with IBM after earning his masters from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. He has worked in multiple technical roles for BigInsights product. He has been working on the Hadoop platform and other open source technologies for 5 years and has deep understanding of these technologies. He has implemented Hadoop projects in various industries for multiple mission critical use cases.</p> ","9000000","1490312019000","22987220","open","37.779998779296875","-122.41999816894531","Big Data Developers in San Francisco","big-data-developers-in-san-francisco","Members","Room 20-20113","238856872","https://www.meetup.com/big-data-developers-in-san-francisco/events/238856872/","","Security and Disaster Recovery for Your Hadoop Clusters","","","","past","1492561800000","1492572162000","-25200000","425 Market Street","","San Francisco","us","24828183","37.79119110107422","USA","-122.39814758300781","IBM","","False","CA","","public","0","18","big-data-developers-in-san-francisco"

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:<br/>  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1400111102000","14461062","open","48.790000915527344","9.1899995803833","Big Data Developers in Stuttgart","Big-Data-Developers-in-Stuttgart","Members","","223231358","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Stuttgart/events/223231358/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data and design (Web Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428599000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","5","Big-Data-Developers-in-Stuttgart"

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that´s why ""In Silico Medicine"" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark.

Brett Rudenstein, Director of Product Management, Big Data, Wandisco</p> <p>Brett Rudenstein has an extensive background in Application Lifecycle Management, High Performance Computing and Open Source Software Analysis. He has held senior sales engineering and management positions at Rational Software, PureAtria, IBM, Appistry and Palamida. Throughout his career, he has enabled organizations to accelerate technology adoption by understanding their needs and providing just-in-time business solutions. As WANdisco Director of Product Management for Big Data, Brett works with partners, prospects, and customers to help them understand and evolve the requirements for enterprise-ready Hadoop.</p> <p><br/>----------------</p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action. </p> <p>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components: </p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss <br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing <br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs. </p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark” </p> <p><br/><b>Big SQL 4.1.</b> Presenters: </p> <p> Michael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM</p> <p> Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics. </p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources. </p> <p><b>PARKING</b></p> <p>Street parking in certain areas (across the street &amp; up to 2 blocks away) at 5pm is free.  Check the signs so as not to get booted! </p> <p>Garage parking is on Columbus Drive in the same building as HopsScotch.  They validate parking for $2.00 up to 4 hours. </p> ","","1446859015000","19097690","open","40.72999954223633","-74.05000305175781","Open Source Analytics - New Jersey","Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey","Members","","226603326","https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey/events/226603326/","49","Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud","","","","past","1449700200000","1449844892000","-18000000","286 Washington St","","Jersey City","us","24219644","40.71782302856445","USA","-74.03630828857422","HopsScotch","","False","NJ","","public","0","49","Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey"

"3","1485373101000","<p>Structured Streaming is a new scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine built on the Spark SQL engine. Structured Streaming allows you to express your streaming computation the same way you would express a computation on static data. This has two benefits. The first is code reuse as essentially the same queries be run on batch, interactive or streaming data. Second, it simplifies streaming application development as you can operate on streams of data just like you can on static data using DataFrames. Structured Streaming abstracts away the complexity of streaming analytics allowing you to perform streaming analytics without having to reason about streaming. The Spark SQL engine takes care of running Structured Streaming queries and incrementally and continuously updating the result as streaming data continues to arrive. With Spark Structured Streaming, you can express streaming aggregations, event-time windows, as well as join streaming data to static data. In this session, we’ll walk through the basics of Structured Streaming, its programming model and APIs. The concepts will be illustrated using code examples. Then, we’ll walk through a demo of analyzing both static and streaming sensor data to show how the same queries can be used on each, thereby simplifying streaming analytics application development, and how static and streaming data can be leveraged together.</p> ","3600000","1446859015000","19097690","open","40.72999954223633","-74.05000305175781","Open Source Analytics - New Jersey","Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey","Members","","237196748","https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey/events/237196748/","","Introduction to Spark Structured Streaming","","","","past","1487178000000","1487185491000","-18000000","http://bit.ly/2jfIfdA","","Jersey City","us","25012022","0.0","USA","0.0","Live Webinar","","False","NJ","","public","0","29","Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey"

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.

Throughout his career, he has enabled organizations to accelerate technology adoption by understanding their needs and providing just-in-time business solutions. As WANdisco Director of Product Management for Big Data, Brett works with partners, prospects, and customers to help them understand and evolve the requirements for enterprise-ready Hadoop. </p> <p>----------------</p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action. </p> <p>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components: </p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss <br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing <br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs. </p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark” </p> <p><br/>Big SQL 4.1. Presenters: </p> <p> Michael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM</p> <p> Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics. </p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources. </p> <p><b>PARKING</b></p> <p>Street parking in certain areas (across the street &amp; up to 2 blocks away) at 5pm is free.  Check the signs so as not to get booted! </p> <p>Garage parking is on Columbus Drive in the same building as HopsScotch.  They validate parking for $2.00 up to 4 hours. </p> ","10800000","1349980140000","5347552","open","40.77000045776367","-73.98999786376953","Big Data Developers in NYC","Big-Data-Developers-in-NYC","Developers","https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=286+Washington+St,+Jersey+City,+NJ,+us","226995075","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-NYC/events/226995075/","","Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud","","","","past","1449700200000","1457722209000","-18000000","286 Washington Street","","Jersey City","us","24226629","40.71782302856445","USA","-74.03630828857422","HopScotch","","False","NJ","","public","0","63","Big-Data-Developers-in-NYC"

Exponentially increasing amounts of data (Volume) need to be processed to yield correct actions (Veracity). These new analytics applications must also be flexible in terms of deployment - employing a combination of cloud and on-premise resources as required to meet the needs of the business. This type of hybrid cloud, near real time analytic application requires streaming analytics capabilities, messaging systems and secure gateways to integrate cloud and on-premise systems. </p> <p>In this meetup, we'll walk through how to create such an application. Simulated sensor data will be pre-processed in a node.js cloud application, transported via TCP to an on-premise Apache Kafka messaging system over a secure gateway, and monitored and analyzed with a Spark Streaming application running on Hadoop. We will explore the various technology components used in this application as well as demonstrate how they integrate in an end-to-end application flow. We will also do a deep dive into the Spark Streaming application itself.</p> <p><br/>Agenda:<br/>- Networking, pizza, soda, snacks<br/>- Overview presentation covering the underlying technology components<br/>- Demo showing the various components of the application<br/>- Discussion with Q&amp;A</p> <p><b>Note: </b>Visit <a href=""https://ibm.biz/NYC_Meetup""><a href=""https://ibm.biz/NYC_Meetup"" class=""linkified"">https://ibm.biz/NYC_Meetup</a></a> to sign up for a free Bluemix account if you don't have one!</p> ","8100000","1349980140000","5347552","open","40.77000045776367","-73.98999786376953","Big Data Developers in NYC","Big-Data-Developers-in-NYC","Developers","12th floor - Room 1219","230374767","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-NYC/events/230374767/","","Analysis of streaming sensor data with Spark & Kafka on Bluemix","","","","past","1461793500000","1461803276000","-14400000","590 madison ave","","New York","us","23813937","40.76219177246094","USA","-73.97249603271484","ibm","","False","NY","","public","0","145","Big-Data-Developers-in-NYC"

"14","1384550359000","<p>Join us on Thursday, December 5th at 6:00pm to learn how we can gain new insights by analyzing machine logs using Machine Data Analytics. </p> <p>Half of Fortune 500 companies experience more than 80 hours of system down time annually. Spread evenly over a year, that amounts to approximately 13 minutes every day. As a consumer, the thought of online bank operations being inaccessible so frequently is disturbing. As a business owner, when systems go down, all processes come to a stop. Work in progress is destroyed and failure to meet SLA’s and contractual obligations can result in expensive fees, adverse publicity, and loss of current and potential future customers. Ultimately the inability to provide a reliable and stable system results in loss of $$$’s. While the failure of these systems is inevitable, the ability to timely predict failures and intercept them before they occur is now a requirement.</p> <p>A possible solution to the problem can be found is in the huge volumes of diagnostic big data generated at hardware, firmware, middleware, application, storage and management layers indicating failures or errors. Machine analysis and understanding of this data is becoming an important part of debugging, performance analysis, root cause analysis and business analysis. In addition to preventing outages, machine data analysis can also provide insights for fraud detection, customer retention and other important use cases. </p> <p>This Meetup is FREE.  Food and Beverages will also be provided. </p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:00pm-7pm: Registration / Food and Beverages </p> <p>7:00pm: Topic Presentation</p> <p>7:45-8pm: Break</p> <p>8pm: Live Demo</p> <p>8:30pm: Networking</p> ","10800000","1338938692000","4013112","open","37.18000030517578","-121.75","Big Data Developers","BigDataDevelopers","Members","","151114922","https://www.meetup.com/BigDataDevelopers/events/151114922/","","Gain New Insights by Analyzing Machine Logs using Machine Data Analytics","","","","past","1386295200000","1394830738000","-28800000","1001 E.

In a few years, the automotive industry will be the largest data producer of data after utilities -- bigger than health care. And with this Big Data volume comes Big Data challenges. The opportunity for applying all this data in real-time to problems in transportation, congestion management, emergency response, microweather prediction, supply chain management, and so on is tremendous. But this requires a real-time analytics platform that can integrate GPS locations, telematics messages and sensor readings, video, and other kinds of information--and scale up to any level. Beyond automotive applications, the need for a real-time big-data analytics platform is becoming critical in other industries, including Government, Telecommunications, Healthcare, Energy and Utilities, Finance, and Manufacturing.</p> <p>Bring your laptop, because you'll have an opportunity to get hands-on with InfoSphere Streams and apply this exciting new technology yourself!

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine?

The big data community has been making great strides in recent years to secure Hadoop clusters where all aspects of security are now covered—authentication, authorization, encryption of data-in-transit, encryption of data-at-rest, and centralized auditing. At the same time, many challenges are still facing cluster administrators who are responsible for setting up security, and developers who are charged with integrating new services into existing secure clusters.  In this talk, we’ll cover basic concepts that form the foundation of big data security such as Kerberos/SPNEGO, impersonation, TLS and encryption key management. We’ll discuss challenges we’ve had in deploying the Hadoop clusters in real-world scenarios and lessons learned when integrating new components/services into secure clusters.</p> <p><br/><i><b>Presenter: Richard Ding, IBM</b></i><br/>Richard Ding is big data architect for IBM, who is responsible for the security aspects of IBM Open Platform and IBM BigInsights, IBM’s 100% open source Hadoop distribution. Over the past years, he has been working with customers to setup secure Spark/Hadoop clusters and helping developers to integrate new services into secure clusters.</p> <p><b>Part </b><b>II</b><b>: </b><b>Disaster </b><b>Recovery</b><b> on Hadoop</b></p> <p>As organizations’ maturity levels around big data technologies increase, we’re seeing a rise in the use of Apache Hadoop as a component of business-critical systems which raises new risks from an IT management perspective. They need the same kind of protection as any other tier-one system, in terms of high availability and disaster recovery capabilities. In this meetup we will focus on different replication strategies that can be leveraged based on RTO and RPO requirements and their pro's and cons.</p> <p><br/><i><b>Presenter:  Vinayak Agrawal, IBM</b></i><br/>Vinayak (Vin) Agrawal is the Product Manager for Big Replicate at IBM. He started his career with IBM after earning his masters from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. He has worked in multiple technical roles for BigInsights product. He has been working on the Hadoop platform and other open source technologies for 5 years and has deep understanding of these technologies. He has implemented Hadoop projects in various industries for multiple mission critical use cases. </p> ","9000000","1338938692000","4013112","open","37.18000030517578","-121.75","Big Data Developers","BigDataDevelopers","Members","Room: 20-20113.

Presenters:</b></p> <p><b>Rick Tarro, Jeffrey Carlson - IBM Analytics<br/></b></p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action. </p> <p>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components: </p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss <br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing <br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs. </p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark” </p> <p><br/><b>BigSQL 4.1. Presenters: </b>Rick Tarro, Jeffrey Carlson, IBM</p> <p> Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics. </p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible.

Structured Streaming allows you to express your streaming computation the same way you would express a computation on static data. This has two benefits. The first is code reuse as essentially the same queries be run on batch, interactive or streaming data. Second, it simplifies streaming application development as you can operate on streams of data just like you can on static data using DataFrames. Structured Streaming abstracts away the complexity of streaming analytics allowing you to perform streaming analytics without having to reason about streaming. The Spark SQL engine takes care of running Structured Streaming queries and incrementally and continuously updating the result as streaming data continues to arrive. With Spark Structured Streaming, you can express streaming aggregations, event-time windows, as well as join streaming data to static data. In this session, we’ll walk through the basics of Structured Streaming, its programming model and APIs. The concepts will be illustrated using code examples.

Summary:</p> <p>

Learn how real-time processing of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data is done using a modern streaming engine (in this case IBM InfoSphere Streams) but the concepts you will learn are also applicable to Apache Storm or Spark Streaming</p> <p>

Highlights:</p> <p>

- Data at Rest vs. Data in Motion</p> <p><br/>- Operations on Streams, Windowing, Punctuations</p> <p><br/>- Sort, Filter, Aggregate, Merge, Join, Spit Data</p> <p><br/>- Extend Engine with Java Operators</p> <p><br/>- Extend Engine with C/C++ Operators</p> <p>

Description:</p> <p>

This course is designed to teach you about the Streams Processing Language. It will begin with the basic concepts of InfoSphere Streams and the basic Streams Processing Language operators used in a Streams program. You will learn how to access data from an external source using the Source type operators and write an output stream using the Sink type operators. You will then learn how and when to use the various Stream operators, like the Functor, Punctor, Aggregation, Sort, Join, Split, Barrier, Delay, and Switch operators. Lab exercise demonstrations will use the InfoSphere Streams IDE that is based upon Eclipse as the development and testing environment, but you will get the opportunity to see the invocation of the compilation of a Streams program from the command line as well.</p> <p>

Hadoop workloads today rely on commodity x86 infrastructure, which although having cheaper costs, also provide lower reliability than UNIX Servers. IBM, through its proprietary POWER Architecture, wants to provide an alternative, aimed at achieving a higher performance at comparable prices. We will discuss IBM's Hadoop Reference Architecture, its performance, and the technical features of the POWER Chip, that enable Hadoop workloads to run faster, and achieve higher throughput per core.</p> <p>

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design. There will be a live demo showcase, refreshments, and a Town Hall discussion featuring some of the most trail-blazing data scientists in today's Spark Community, including:</p> <p>•  Edd Dumbill, VP Strategy, Silicon Valley Data Science<br/>•  Mike Tamir, Chief Science Officer &amp; VP of Data Science &amp; Education at Galvanize<br/>•   Fernando Perez, Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory &amp; Founding Investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science<br/>•   Haoyuan Li, CEO and Founder of Tachyon Nexus<br/>•   Shankar Venkataraman, Distinguished Engineer &amp; CTO, IBM Analytics Platform at IBM<br/>•   Paco Nathan, Director, Community Evangelism, Databricks</p> <p>Spark Community members will also deliver 5-minute lightning talks to describe exciting projects they're working on.</p> <p>We will provide a livestream presentation of what these Spark leaders have to say.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming Link:</b></p> <p><b>To get additional details about Spark you can sign up now for a reminder at:</b></p> <p><b><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>Scroll down to ""Can't attend in Person""?  Sign up for a reminder and add it to your calendar.</b></p> <p>Additional information on Spark:</p> <p>Link to Spark Fundamentals Course in Big Data University</p> <p><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/</a></a></p> <p>Link to Spark Technology Information</p> <p><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/""><a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/</a></a></p> <p>Happy Sparking.</p> ","6300000","1378937069000","10220112","open","47.380001068115234","8.539999961853027","Big Data Developers in Switzerland","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland","Members","","223230880","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/223230880/","","IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only)","","","","past","1434420000000","1434428598000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","16","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland"

Is there a limit to Moore's law?</p> <p>Dr. Axel Koester, Chief Technologist, IBM EMEA Storage Competence Center Mainz</p> <p>6:30-6:50 PM Real time video analytics with InfoSphere Streams, OpenCV and R (live demo) and real life experiences with streaming analytics</p> <p>Unstructured data are a fast growing area and a source for many innovative Big Data &amp; Analytics solutions. Often the first idea of unstructured data seems to be that it's probably text data, even though that is just a small part. A lot of that ""new data"" is sensor data and especially multimedia (audio, video). Even though this part is growing extremely fast, it is very rarely used in analytics today.

The buzzword behind this is DOCKER. Although present for many years in cgroups, namespaces and LXC - container based virtualzation really took off as Docker Inc. brought this technology to the masses. Today, every 2nd IT startup is running on DOCKER. Enterprises and Academic institutions are slowly adapting as well. In this session we will learn what DOCKER really is, what Linux Kernel extensions are used and how you can use it in your environment. We will create a DOCKER image from scratch, add persistent storage to it and showcase a little cluster computing task using ApacheFlink and DOCKER-Compose. Finally I'll give you a short introduction to DOCKER on the cloud - currently offered by nearly every cloud service provider - and exemplified in the IBM Bluemix Platform Cloud.</p> <p>Note: If available please bring your own laptop to the seminar.</p> ","7200000","1378937069000","10220112","open","47.380001068115234","8.539999961853027","Big Data Developers in Switzerland","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland","Members","","227288426","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/227288426/","","Introduction to Docker","","","","past","1449666000000","1449674488000","3600000","Baltzerstrasse 4","","Berne","ch","24247058","46.951908111572266","Switzerland","7.428583145141602","Institute of cell biology, Seminar room C159","","False","","","public","0","5","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland"

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that´s why ""In Silico Medicine"" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live"" class=""embedded"">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ","1800000","1378937069000","10220112","open","47.380001068115234","8.539999961853027","Big Data Developers in Switzerland","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland","Members","","234293127","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/234293127/","","Webcast MipTec Basel: Massive parallel GPU accelerated DeepLearning in the cloud","","","","past","1474555500000","1474559248000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","10","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland"

Agenda</p> <p>18:00 Welcome &amp; Intro</p> <p>18:10<br/>Title: <b>Data Science and Data Products at Neue Zürcher Zeitung</b></p> <p>Abstract:<br/>With 236 years of age, Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) is one of the oldest still published newspapers in the world. However, despite its age, NZZ is far from being old-fashioned. Especially when it comes to data-driven decision making and data-driven innovation, NZZ has been investing a lot within the last three years. For wrangling large amounts of data we have been using Apache Spark for almost a year now – and do not regret this choice. It had not only given us flexibility with ad-hoc analytics, but also drives our data-products (in production). In this talk I will share some of our use cases as well as insights we gained over the last year with Apache Spark. I will especially talk about how we calculate article recommendations and showcase some new exciting data products which are currently in active development. </p> <p>Bio: <br/>René Pfitzner is the Lead Data Scientist at NZZ, Switzerland’s newspaper of records. He is interested in media innovation, especially algorithmic approaches for news media. Before joining NZZ he has been a research assistant at ETH Zurich, where his research broadly evolved around the topics “network theory” and “information networks”.</p> <p>18:50 tba</p> <p>19:30 Networking</p> ","","1378937069000","10220112","open","47.380001068115234","8.539999961853027","Big Data Developers in Switzerland","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland","Members","","236232887","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/236232887/","","19th Swiss Big Data User Group Meeting","","","","past","1485190800000","1485203021000","3600000","Rämistrasse 101","","Zürich","ch","24945777","47.37653732299805","Switzerland","8.54809284210205"," ETH Zurich, Room HG D 3.2 ","","False","","","public","0","53","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland"

But there’s a difference between ""playing"" with big data versus solving real problems. The reality is that Hadoop alone might not be enough. Experience IBM’s <b>enterprise-class Hadoop</b> product, InfoSphere BigInsights, which enhances open source Hadoop with required enterprise capabilities including: analytics, visualisation, security, standard SQL, enterprise HBase, developer/admin tools.</p> <p>We will kick off with <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata/use-cases.html"">Big Data use case</a> discussions and an overview of what big data really is, and then move quickly to get hands-on with Big Data using <a href=""http://ibm.co/quickstart"">InfoSphere BigInsights Quick Start Edition</a> with guidance from development experts. This is a unique opportunity to develop skills and learn about exciting technologies and techniques that you can immediately take back to your organisation.</p> <p><b>This event is <i>FREE</i>.</b> Drinks and some food will be provided.</p> <p>Agenda (subject to change) <br/>6.30pm to 7pm Arrivals &amp; Registration</p> <p>7pm to 7.15pm Welcome and Keynote - <b>Big Data Overview</b></p> <p>7.15pm to 7.30pm <b>Big Data @ Rest (Hadoop)</b></p> <p>7.30pm to 9pm <b>Hands-on Lab</b> - tentative labs</p> <p>            • Lever the full power of SQL with Hadoop</p> <p>Labs will use <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/biginsights/quick-start/"">BigInsights Quick Start VM</a>.  To learn more beforehand and get hands on go to <a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/"">Big Data University</a>.  By downloading the IBM BigInsights Quick Start Edition VM <b>in advance,</b> participants will have the chance to get hands on with IBM's enterprise-class Hadoop distribution. A facilitated lab exercise will walk through the process of generating and loading data and then creating the necessary structures to query it using IBM's full ANSI standard SQL interface.

<i>Are you interested in getting to grips with machine learning, and how it can be used to create an Internet of Things system with IBM SystemML and Apache Spark? </i></p> <p>


Nikolay Manchev (Big Data Technical Specialist, IBM Analytics) will cover IBM's commitment to Spark, how IBM SystemML can help advance machine learning, how to roll out machine learning algorithms in production and how to achieve shorter development times and increased algorithm performance</p> <p>



Jan Machacek (Cake Solutions) will explore the latest developments of the MUVR project. After a brief introduction on the nature of distributed systems (from distributed databases, through distributed state, to distributed computation), you will learn how to use Akka Cluster and Akka Persistence to implement such distributed systems. Once the data is safely stored in a journal, it is important to be able to perform deeper analysis. To do so, Jan will show you how to access the data in the journal in a distributed computation program running in Apache Spark.</p> <p>With the mechanics done, Jan will explain how to use (deep) neural networks that can be very easily trained to recognize patterns in the ingested data.</p> <p>You will learn the advantages and traps of designing distributed domains, data and computation: systems that may become the next generation of financial systems, bringing elasticity, resilience and responsiveness. You will look in particular at systems that consume data from IoT / wearables, and that perform immediate and batch analyses.</p> <p>

We're now building thinking tools and machines to help us with mental tasks, in the same way that mechanical robots already help us with physical work.

We are now in-between two computing ages: the older, transactional computing era and a new cognitive one. </p> <p>In this new world, Big Data is a must-have resource for any cutting-edge enterprise project.  And this Big Data serves as an excellent resource for building intelligence of all kinds: artificial smartness, intelligence as a service, emotional intelligence, invisible interfaces, and attempts at true general AI. However, often with new projects you have no data to begin with. So the challenge is, how do you acquire or produce data? During this session, Vasyl will discuss what the process of creation of new technology to solve business problems, and the strategies for approaching the “No Data Challenge”, including:</p> <p>·  Using software and hardware agents capable of recording new types of data;</p> <p>·  The five Sources of Big Data;</p> <p>·  The Six Graphs of Big Data as strategies for modern solutions; and</p> <p>·  The Eight Exponential Technologies.</p> <p>This new era of computing is all about the end user or professional user, and these new AI tools will help to improve their lifestyle and solve their problems.</p> <p><b>Vasyl Mylko</b> is responsible for research and thought leadership including Cognitive Computing, Emotional Intelligence,  Internet of Things, Healthcare,  Advanced Analytics, User Experience and Mobility and Wearables. Vasyl built SoftServe's Design Office and Security Competency - he holds a Master’s Degree in Cybernetics from Ivan Franko National University in Lviv, Ukraine.</p> <p><br/><a href=""https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/valentyn-kropov""> </a></p> <p><b>An Introduction to Graph databases and IBM Graph </b></p> <p>A graph database is designed to help you answer questions about large or complex networks of inter-related data. They represent data as ‘vertices’, sometimes called ‘nodes’. The relationships between vertices are represented by connections called ‘edges’. Graph databases also store metadata or ‘properties’ about vertices and edges. Graph database applications came to prominence when modeling complex networks of related data, include modelling and applying social networks, constructing and developing recommendation engines, and ‘optimal route’ challenges such as finding the shortest path or solving the vehicle routing problem. In this session you'll learn how you can get started with IBM Graph to analyse your data.</p> <p><a href=""https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/mike-elsmore""> </a></p> <p><b>Mike Elsmore</b> spends his days as Developer Advocate at IBM Cloud Data Services, using his time to share knowledge on rapid development and different databases.

IPython notebook is an established tool in the Data Science community and embedding the application's Spark Context within it, can speed up development and limit errors. One possible usage model is to share a set of precomputed RDDs cached in Spark's cluster memory between multiple users. This approach reduces the resource usage, since the precomputation happens only once and the cached data is not replicated for each user. Sharing SQL contexts allows instantaneous access to temporary results by other users. We’ll conclude the session with presenting how this solution helped to bring interactive notebooks into our flagship Big Data processing platform: Seahorse.</p> <p>Piotr Łusakowsk, Technical Leader, deepsense.io</p> <p>Piotr graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics at University of Warsaw.

<b>Analysing social media conversation during the 2016 Wimbledon Tournament </b></p> <p>The Summer of 2016 was unusual in sporting terms, with several events taking place simultaneously (Euro 2016 Football Championships, 2016 Copa América, the Tour de France, two F1 Grand Prix and the build up to the Rio Olympics). The packed schedule presented a challenge to Wimbledon, in vying for sports fans attention, but also an opportunity to draw in fans from other sports. In order to make their own editorial content relevant, Wimbledon needed to understand what tennis and general sports fans were talking about and where their interests lay.</p> <p>The Cognitive Social Command Centre (CSCC) used IBM's Watson technology &amp; the Spark platform to identify, in real-time, emerging topics of conversation around Wimbledon and the other sports events. It highlighted which of those topics had the potential to perform best and what content was being engaged with now. By using a Cognitive solution that was trained not programmed, the system was continually improving throughout the Championships, learning what was being said about Wimbledon and the other sporting events.</p> <p>Adelina Balasa, Technical Consultant, IBM Cloud</p> <p><br/>Adelina has been with IBM for 3 years and during this time she’s developed a very broad set of skills, from technical expertise to project management to creative work.

So how do we find new molecules for the drugs, materials, additives (etc) of the future? High-throughput virtual screening now allows us to scan millions of molecules, but this is still many orders of magnitude too small. The use of deep learning can both accelerate our search by speeding up (for example) property calculations, and by moving us towards an intelligent means of searching this vast space. I will introduce various types of neural network, and show how you can use them to speed up search problems by coupling them with a state of the art technique called Bayesian Optimization.</p> <p>&lt;a href=""https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/edward-pyzer-knapp""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; <i>Edward Pyzer-Knapp</i> obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge using simulation-based techniques to help guide experimental materials design.
