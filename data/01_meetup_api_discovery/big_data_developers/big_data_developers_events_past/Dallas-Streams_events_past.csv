Spark is recognized as a great analytics engine. One of its benefits is its inclusion of machine learning algorithms that can group, predict, classify and even recommend based on the analysis of a corpus of data. Once the model is created, it can be applied to new data. In some situations, there is a need to score the model while the data is streaming to decide what to do with the new data.</p> <p>In this latest Data Science Central Webinar event, you will learn how to process the data to arrive at a model and how the resulting model can be used to score streaming data using IBM Streams.</p> <p><br/><b>Register Online Here:   <a href=""http://bit.ly/2o4YZag""><a href=""http://bit.ly/2o4YZag"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2o4YZag</a></a></b></p> ","","1435781750000","18712651","open","32.790000915527344","-96.80000305175781","Dallas Streams","Dallas-Streams","Streamers","Register Online and Secure Your Spot!","238618818","https://www.meetup.com/Dallas-Streams/events/238618818/","","Apache Spark and IBM Streams Working Together in Streaming Analytics","","","","past","1490716800000","1490728898000","-18000000","http://bit.ly/2o4YZag","","Dallas","us","25124766","0.0","USA","0.0","Live Webinar","","False","TX","","public","0","13"
