Making Hadoop Better with NoSQL.</b></p> <p>Hadoop has become popular because it is designed to cheaply store that data in the Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) and run large-scale MapReduce jobs for batch analysis. However\u00a0Hadoop is not designed for low latency transactions required for real-time interactive applications, or applications that require enterprise features such as government-grade security and high availability and disaster recovery. Even as the Hadoop ecosystem continues to evolve, the real benefits of Hadoop are enhanced when running alongside an enterprise-grade database.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>2. The Requirements of an Enterprise NoSQL platform.</b></p> <p><br/>As more and more businesses look towards NoSQL as providing a better platform choice over traditional RDBMS to support business agility, they soon discover a myriad of offerings all pro-porting to deliver on Big Data challenges.\u00a0However, quite soon small pilots evolve and developers being to encounter coding complexity as they attempt resolve lacking database features which they take for granted from their mature enterprise RDBMS equivalents.\u00a0<br/>We will discuss the common enterprise feature challenges and what differentiates an Enterprise NoSQL platform to highlight the pitfalls and considerations of new deployments.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nThanks, James.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 1}, {"created": 1434938862000, "duration": 9000000, "id": "223406527", "name": "Data Sharing for the Paranoid - What Financial Services is learning from Govt", "status": "past", "time": 1436254200000, "updated": 1436264165000, "utc_offset": 36000000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 7, "venue": {"id": 23766434, "name": "York Conference and Function Centre", "lat": -33.87015914916992, "lon": 151.205810546875, "repinned": false, "address_1": "Level 2, 99 York St, Sydney ", "city": "Sydney", "country": "au", "localized_country_name": "Australia"}, "group": {"created": 1427687627000, "name": "Sydney MarkLogic NoSQL MeetUp", "id": 18525544, "join_mode": "open", "lat": -33.869998931884766, "lon": 151.2100067138672, "urlname": "Sydney-MarkLogic-NoSQL-MeetUp", "who": "members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-MarkLogic-NoSQL-MeetUp/events/223406527/", "description": "<p>Hi all,</p> <p>this month we will be co-hosting our MeetUp with the \u00a0\"Big Data for the Banking &amp; Finance sector\" Meetup group, for a \"NoSQL\" / \"Big Data\" themed event.</p> <p><br/>This July, we are privileged to have presentations from two thought leaders in security, suspicious activity monitoring and intelligence analysis. Drawing from real-world cases, they will each present a 30-minute thought provoking session on the trends in this fascinating and rapidly evolving area of technology.</p> <p><br/>\"Organisations of all types need to observe behavior, activities, and other changing information over time \u2013 and generate actionable intelligence that lets them intervene to keep their customers, the public, or their businesses safe from harm.</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Law enforcement organizations perform suspicious activity monitoring as a foundational part of police and detective work</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Financial services institutions improve oversight with \u201cknow your customer\u201d (KYC), anti-money-laundering, and trader surveillance initiatives</p> <p><br/>\u2022 National defence and security agencies \u201cconnect the dots\u201d in disparate data to prevent terrorist attacks</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Healthcare and insurance organizations look for potential claims fraud</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Nearly every industry has teams focusing on cyber-crime and cyber-defence</p> <p><br/>In all cases, it is crucial to integrate data from a variety of heterogeneous sources \u2013 as fast as possible \u2013 and provide alerts on unusual activities to the people who need to know and respond. Join us as we discuss how to address this imperative.\"</p> <p><br/>Our presenters will be Billy Sokol and James Clippinger.</p> <p><br/>Billy is an industry expert and thought leader in data management, program leadership, solution design, analysis and business process reengineering for defense, security and public safety and has worked with dozens of agencies in over ten countries. He has over 20 years in enterprise technology delivery and management, with deep experience in defense, security &amp; and public safety.</p> <p><br/>James Clippinger is the Director of Global Technical Services at MarkLogic. James has served as chief data engineer on several US government projects. Prior to MarkLogic, James was a senior search architect at Verity and Autonomy and a consultant at Hamiltonian Solutions. As part of his graduate research at Dartmouth College, he designed algorithms for parallel disk systems, implemented code for optimal parallel fast Fourier transforms, and researched parallel software optimization with Sun Microsystems\u2019 HPC group.</p> <p><br/>I hope you can join us for these presentations from two extremely knowledgeable experts on this fascinating and highly relevant topic.</p> <p>Complementary food and drinks will be served.\u00a0</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1456274409000, "duration": 8100000, "id": "229081983", "name": "Everything You Wanted To Know About MarkLogic, But Were Too Afraid To Ask", "status": "past", "time": 1457420400000, "updated": 1457494640000, "utc_offset": 39600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 16, "venue": {"id": 23766434, "name": "York Conference and Function Centre", "lat": -33.87015914916992, "lon": 151.205810546875, "repinned": false, "address_1": "Level 2, 99 York St, Sydney ", "city": "Sydney", "country": "au", "localized_country_name": "Australia"}, "group": {"created": 1427687627000, "name": "Sydney MarkLogic NoSQL MeetUp", "id": 18525544, "join_mode": "open", "lat": -33.869998931884766, "lon": 151.2100067138672, "urlname": "Sydney-MarkLogic-NoSQL-MeetUp", "who": "members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-MarkLogic-NoSQL-MeetUp/events/229081983/", "description": "<p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>This month's\u00a0meet up will include presentations from two NoSQL experts.</p> <p>Daniel Holgate, a Senior Sales Engineer at MarkLogic Australia, will be presenting on building a demo with\u00a0NoSQL in just 15 minutes. \u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Watch us build a live prototype using MarkLogic, combining structured and unstructured data in ways you\u2019ve never seen before to get more insight and discovery.

What black magic lets an Enterprise NoSQL database like MarkLogic load a variety of XML and JSON data with different schemas, then run super fast ad hoc queries against the data without having to know in advance either the shape of the data or the style of the queries? It seems completely impossible, but it's real, its not even that complicated, and yet it fundamentally changes the game for databases.</p> <p>I hope you can join us for these presentations from two extremely knowledgeable experts on this fascinating and highly relevant topic.</p> <p>Complementary food and drinks will be served.\u00a0</p> <p>The doors will open at 6 pm for a 6:30 pm start time.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 1}]
