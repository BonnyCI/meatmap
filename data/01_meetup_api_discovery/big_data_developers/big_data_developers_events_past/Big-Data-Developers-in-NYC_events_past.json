Spark 1.5 ships major pieces of Project Tungsten, an initiative focused on increasing Spark\u2019s performance through several low-level architectural optimizations. The release also adds operational features for the streaming component, such as backpressure support. Another major theme of this release is data science: Spark 1.5 ships several new machine learning algorithms and utilities, and extends Spark\u2019s new R API with distributed GLM.<br/>We will give a high level intro of the release, dive into Project Tungsten and Spark Streaming, and discuss future plans.</p> <p>Speakers:<br/>Tathagata Das, Patrick Wendell, Reynold Xin, Databricks<br/>Dean Wampler, Ph.D. (@deanwampler) leads the Big Data efforts at Typesafe, focusing on Spark, Mesos, Hadoop, Akka, and other tools.

He has held senior sales engineering and management positions at Rational Software, PureAtria,\u00a0IBM, Appistry and Palamida. Throughout his career, he has enabled organizations to accelerate technology adoption by understanding their needs and providing just-in-time business solutions. As WANdisco Director of Product Management for Big Data, Brett works with partners, prospects, and customers to help them understand and evolve the requirements for enterprise-ready Hadoop.\u00a0</p> <p>----------------</p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion\u2014immediate response and action.\u00a0</p> <p>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:\u00a0</p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics\u00a0applications without downtime or data loss\u00a0<br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing\u00a0<br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.\u00a0</p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the \u201cbest in class\u201d architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with \u201cContinuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark\u201d\u00a0</p> <p><br/>Big SQL 4.1.\u00a0Presenters:\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0Michael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM</p> <p>\u00a0Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.\u00a0</p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible.

Exponentially increasing amounts of data (Volume) need to be processed to yield correct actions (Veracity). These new analytics applications must also be flexible in terms of deployment - employing a combination of cloud and on-premise resources as required to meet the needs of the business. This type of hybrid cloud, near real time analytic application requires streaming analytics capabilities, messaging systems and secure gateways to integrate cloud and on-premise systems.\u00a0</p> <p>In this meetup, we'll walk through how to create such an application. Simulated sensor data will be pre-processed in a node.js cloud application, transported via TCP to an on-premise Apache Kafka messaging system over a secure gateway, and monitored and analyzed with a Spark Streaming application running on Hadoop. We will explore the various technology components used in this application as well as demonstrate how they integrate in an end-to-end application flow.
