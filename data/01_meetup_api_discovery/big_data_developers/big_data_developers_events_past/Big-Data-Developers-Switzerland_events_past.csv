Summary:</p> <p>

Learn how real-time processing of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data is done using a modern streaming engine (in this case IBM InfoSphere Streams) but the concepts you will learn are also applicable to Apache Storm or Spark Streaming</p> <p>

Highlights:</p> <p>

- Data at Rest vs. Data in Motion</p> <p><br/>- Operations on Streams, Windowing, Punctuations</p> <p><br/>- Sort, Filter, Aggregate, Merge, Join, Spit Data</p> <p><br/>- Extend Engine with Java Operators</p> <p><br/>- Extend Engine with C/C++ Operators</p> <p>

Description:</p> <p>

This course is designed to teach you about the Streams Processing Language. It will begin with the basic concepts of InfoSphere Streams and the basic Streams Processing Language operators used in a Streams program. You will learn how to access data from an external source using the Source type operators and write an output stream using the Sink type operators. You will then learn how and when to use the various Stream operators, like the Functor, Punctor, Aggregation, Sort, Join, Split, Barrier, Delay, and Switch operators. Lab exercise demonstrations will use the InfoSphere Streams IDE that is based upon Eclipse as the development and testing environment, but you will get the opportunity to see the invocation of the compilation of a Streams program from the command line as well.</p> <p>

Hadoop workloads today rely on commodity x86 infrastructure, which although having cheaper costs, also provide lower reliability than UNIX Servers. IBM, through its proprietary POWER Architecture, wants to provide an alternative, aimed at achieving a higher performance at comparable prices. We will discuss IBM's Hadoop Reference Architecture, its performance, and the technical features of the POWER Chip, that enable Hadoop workloads to run faster, and achieve higher throughput per core.</p> <p>

Often the first idea of unstructured data seems to be that it's probably text data, even though that is just a small part. A lot of that ""new data"" is sensor data and especially multimedia (audio, video). Even though this part is growing extremely fast, it is very rarely used in analytics today. And even less in a real time context.</p> <p>I will demonstrate what does it mean to work with this new data in real time on a live demo and explain important concepts &amp; implementation approaches.

The buzzword behind this is DOCKER. Although present for many years in cgroups, namespaces and LXC - container based virtualzation really took off as Docker Inc. brought this technology to the masses. Today, every 2nd IT startup is running on DOCKER. Enterprises and Academic institutions are slowly adapting as well. In this session we will learn what DOCKER really is, what Linux Kernel extensions are used and how you can use it in your environment. We will create a DOCKER image from scratch, add persistent storage to it and showcase a little cluster computing task using ApacheFlink and DOCKER-Compose. Finally I'll give you a short introduction to DOCKER on the cloud - currently offered by nearly every cloud service provider - and exemplified in the IBM Bluemix Platform Cloud.</p> <p>Note: If available please bring your own laptop to the seminar.</p> ","7200000","1378937069000","10220112","open","47.380001068115234","8.539999961853027","Big Data Developers in Switzerland","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland","Members","","227288426","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/227288426/","","Introduction to Docker","","","","past","1449666000000","1449674488000","3600000","Baltzerstrasse 4","","Berne","ch","24247058","46.951908111572266","Switzerland","7.428583145141602","Institute of cell biology, Seminar room C159","","False","","","public","0","5"

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that´s why ""In Silico Medicine"" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live"" class=""embedded"">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ","1800000","1378937069000","10220112","open","47.380001068115234","8.539999961853027","Big Data Developers in Switzerland","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland","Members","","234293127","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/234293127/","","Webcast MipTec Basel: Massive parallel GPU accelerated DeepLearning in the cloud","","","","past","1474555500000","1474559248000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","10"

Agenda</p> <p>18:00 Welcome &amp; Intro</p> <p>18:10<br/>Title: <b>Data Science and Data Products at Neue Zürcher Zeitung</b></p> <p>Abstract:<br/>With 236 years of age, Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) is one of the oldest still published newspapers in the world. However, despite its age, NZZ is far from being old-fashioned. Especially when it comes to data-driven decision making and data-driven innovation, NZZ has been investing a lot within the last three years. For wrangling large amounts of data we have been using Apache Spark for almost a year now – and do not regret this choice. It had not only given us flexibility with ad-hoc analytics, but also drives our data-products (in production). In this talk I will share some of our use cases as well as insights we gained over the last year with Apache Spark. I will especially talk about how we calculate article recommendations and showcase some new exciting data products which are currently in active development. </p> <p>Bio: <br/>René Pfitzner is the Lead Data Scientist at NZZ, Switzerland’s newspaper of records. He is interested in media innovation, especially algorithmic approaches for news media. Before joining NZZ he has been a research assistant at ETH Zurich, where his research broadly evolved around the topics “network theory” and “information networks”.</p> <p>18:50 tba</p> <p>19:30 Networking</p> ","","1378937069000","10220112","open","47.380001068115234","8.539999961853027","Big Data Developers in Switzerland","Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland","Members","","236232887","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/236232887/","","19th Swiss Big Data User Group Meeting","","","","past","1485190800000","1485203021000","3600000","Rämistrasse 101","","Zürich","ch","24945777","47.37653732299805","Switzerland","8.54809284210205"," ETH Zurich, Room HG D 3.2 ","","False","","","public","0","53"
