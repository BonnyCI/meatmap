However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion\u2014immediate response and action.\u00a0</p> <p>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:\u00a0</p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics\u00a0applications without downtime or data loss\u00a0<br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing\u00a0<br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.\u00a0</p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the \u201cbest in class\u201d architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with \u201cContinuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark\u201d\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.\u00a0</p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Parking Information:</b><br/>Revere Hotel at 200 Stuart Street - $10 for 3 hours<br/>The outdoor Laz parking lot across the street, behind Smith &amp; Wollensky - $7 ($5 off)</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1455907061000, "duration": 10800000, "id": "228978344", "name": "Hybrid solution analysis of streaming sensor data with Spark Streaming & Kafka", "status": "past", "time": 1458079200000, "updated": 1458592994000, "utc_offset": -14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 150, "venue": {"id": 23841480, "name": "51 Melcher Street", "lat": 42.35866165161133, "lon": -71.0567398071289, "repinned": false, "address_1": "WeWork ", "city": "Boston", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "MA"}, "group": {"created": 1374708662000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Boston", "id": 9505222, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 42.36000061035156, "lon": -71.05999755859375, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/228978344/", "description": "<p>Today's analytics applications must not only be capable of handling ever increasing types of data (Variety), they need to do it in near real time (Velocity).

The availability of a rich API has lowered the bar for data scientists by letting them leverage the power of Apache Spark to build machine learning applications without having to write/translate cumbersome Java-based big-data applications. Though the bar to get Apache Spark up and running is low, to fully leverage the power of Spark, applications must be designed and tuned optimally.</p> <p>In this workshop, we will discuss the key tenets of large-scale machine learning and discuss the various algorithms supported by Apache Spark to build statistical and machine learning applications. Through practical case-studies, we will discuss how these algorithms can be applied and scaled to address the big data challenges in the enterprise.</p> <p>Day 1</p> <p>On day one, we will begin with an introduction to Apache Spark. Through examples we will understand how to build applications using PySpark, the Python API for Spark. We will then focus on the MLLib API for building Machine Learning applications in Spark.</p> <p>What you will learn</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Apache Spark: An introduction</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Considerations for large Scale machine learning: How is it different from running algorithms on your laptop?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Basic Statistical techniques in Apache Spark</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Machine Learning Techniques in Apache Spark: Clustering and Classification</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Evaluating performance in machine learning algorithms</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Case study 1: Clustering large financial assets with Apache Spark</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Case study 2: Large Scale regression modeling with Apache Spark</p> <p>Day 2</p> <p>On day two, we will focus on building end-to-end applications with Apache Spark</p> <p>What you will learn</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Feature Engineering with Spark:\u00a0Feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Machine Learning Pipelines: Constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Deploying Machine Learning models: Tools and Best practices</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Case study 3: Processing large datasets with Spark</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Case study 4: An end-to-end machine learning application pipeline</p> <p>All applications will be built on the Data Science Experience platform, courtesy of our sponsors</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/7/5/600_451581365.jpeg\" /></p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 6}, {"created": 1474467666000, "duration": 7200000, "id": "234294524", "name": "Text Classification using Spark Machine Learning", "status": "past", "time": 1477000800000, "updated": 1477279718000, "utc_offset": -14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 270, "venue": {"id": 23817440, "name": "IBM Client Center", "lat": 42.3664665222168, "lon": -71.07735443115234, "repinned": false, "address_1": "1 Rogers Street", "city": "Cambridge", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "MA"}, "group": {"created": 1374708662000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Boston", "id": 9505222, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 42.36000061035156, "lon": -71.05999755859375, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/234294524/", "description": "<p>The goal of text classification is the classification of text documents into a fixed number of predefined categories.

We will see how MLlib provides a set of high-level APIs for constructing, evaluating and tuning a machine learning workflow. We will explore how Spark represents a workflow as a pipeline, which consists of a sequence of stages to be run in a specific order. The pipeline for our text classification use case will utilize transformer stages to prepare the raw text documents for classification and estimator stages to learn a machine learning model that can be used to classify documents. Tuning the model for best fit will also be illustrated.</p> <p>In the session, we'll walk through a detailed demo of text classification running in a Spark notebook</p> <p>Although a document classification use case will be specifically explored, many of the principles demonstrated in the session can be employed in a variety of other machine learning use cases.</p> <p>There is no charge of this event.

Structured Streaming allows you to express your streaming computation the same way you would express a computation on static data. This has two benefits. The first is code reuse as essentially the same queries be run on batch, interactive or streaming data. Second, it simplifies streaming application development as you can operate on streams of data just like you can on static data using DataFrames. Structured Streaming abstracts away the complexity of streaming analytics allowing you to perform streaming analytics without having to reason about streaming.</p> <p>The Spark SQL engine takes care of running Structured Streaming queries and incrementally and continuously updating the result as streaming data continues to arrive. With Spark Structured Streaming, you can express streaming aggregations, event-time windows, as well as join streaming data to static data.</p> <p>In this session, we\u2019ll walk through the basics of Structured Streaming, its programming model and APIs. The concepts will be illustrated using code examples. Then, we\u2019ll walk through a demo of analyzing both static and streaming sensor data to show how the same queries can be used on each, thereby simplifying streaming analytics application development, and how static and streaming data can be leveraged together.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 3}, {"created": 1489776177000, "duration": 115200000, "id": "238496937", "name": "Deep Learning with Keras, Tensorflow and Apache Spark", "status": "past", "time": 1490619600000, "updated": 1490737605000, "utc_offset": -14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 69, "venue": {"id": 25115013, "name": "IBM ", "lat": 42.36613082885742, "lon": -71.08120727539062, "repinned": false, "address_1": "75 Binney Street", "city": "Boston", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "MA"}, "group": {"created": 1374708662000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Boston", "id": 9505222, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 42.36000061035156, "lon": -71.05999755859375, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/238496937/", "description": "<p><b>IBM is hosting this event.
