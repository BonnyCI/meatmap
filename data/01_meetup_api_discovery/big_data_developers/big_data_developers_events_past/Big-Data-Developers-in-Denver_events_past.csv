"3","1401488308000","<p>Join us and participate in an exclusive Big Data Developer Day hosted by the IBM Big Data team.   Open source Apache Hadoop is a great framework for distributed processing of large data sets. But there’s a difference between ""playing"" with big data versus solving real problems. The reality is that Hadoop alone might not be enough. Experience IBM’s enterprise-class Hadoop product, InfoSphere BigInsights, which enhances open source Hadoop with required enterprise capabilities including: analytics, visualization, security, standard SQL, enterprise HBase, developer/admin tools, learn about the role of Big Data in Motion, Big Data Exploration and more. The morning session will include interactive <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata/use-cases.html"">Big Data use case</a> discussions, an overview of what is big data, live demonstrations of key Big Data components (Big Data at Rest, Big Data in Motion).</p> <p><br/><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B27SpLOOhWw"" class=""embedded"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B27SpLOOhWw</a></p> <p>and, in the afternoon, get hands-on with Big Data using <a href=""http://ibm.co/quickstart"">InfoSphere BigInsights Quick Start Edition</a> and <a href=""http://ibm.co/streamsqs"">InfoSphere Streams Quick Start Edition</a> with guidance from development experts.
