This will be our first Meetup at the IBM office in Cambridge.  </p> <p>Big data projects are challenging for many reasons, from scoping out the business problems to be solved, getting the right skills in place, and showing value to the organization. For this reason, some organizations have avoided the tough conversation around managing risk, including the fundamental conversation around information governance, and how to meet data privacy and data security obligations.  </p> <p>In this meetup, our speakers will discuss some approaches to integrating information governance into typical big data projects that include the use of Hadoop for exploration and analysis. This includes metadata management, data masking while maintaining analytical integrity, and monitoring to detect potential internal/external breaches and for demonstrating compliance to specific audit requirements.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:00pm-7pm: Networking (Food &amp; Beverages provided)</p> <p>7:00pm: Presentation</p> <p>7:45-8pm: Break</p> <p>8pm: Live Demo</p> <p>8:30pm: Networking</p> ","9000000","1374708662000","9505222","open","42.36000061035156","-71.05999755859375","Big Data Developers in Boston","Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston","Members","","184373932","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/184373932/","","Considerations for a Holistic Approach to Big Data Security and Privacy","","60","","past","1402437600000","1402499282000","-14400000","1 Rogers Street","","Cambridge","us","14966082","42.3657341003418","USA","-71.07682037353516","IBM Innovation Center","","False","MA","02142","public","0","58"

In his current role he is responsible for overseeing WANdisco's product strategy. In his previous role as a founder and chief technology officer (CTO) of Librados, an application integration software provider, Jim was responsible for overall product strategy and product messaging.  He was also a member of the management team that led the company’s acquisition by NetManage, Inc. Following its acquisition, Jim joined NetManage as CTO for the Librados products group. </p> <p>Prior to Librados, he was the vice president of product management for Insevo, a middleware company specializing in enterprise application integration.

However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action. </p> <p>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components: </p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss <br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing <br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs. </p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark” </p> <p> Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics. </p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources. </p> <p><br/><b>Parking Information:</b><br/>Revere Hotel at 200 Stuart Street - $10 for 3 hours<br/>The outdoor Laz parking lot across the street, behind Smith &amp; Wollensky - $7 ($5 off)</p> ","10800000","1374708662000","9505222","open","42.36000061035156","-71.05999755859375","Big Data Developers in Boston","Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston","Members","","226909204","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/226909204/","","Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud","","","","past","1452637800000","1452650315000","-18000000","100 Arlington Street","","Boston","us","24218129","42.34998321533203","USA","-71.06950378417969","Liquid Art House","","False","MA","","public","0","145"

The availability of a rich API has lowered the bar for data scientists by letting them leverage the power of Apache Spark to build machine learning applications without having to write/translate cumbersome Java-based big-data applications. Though the bar to get Apache Spark up and running is low, to fully leverage the power of Spark, applications must be designed and tuned optimally.</p> <p>In this workshop, we will discuss the key tenets of large-scale machine learning and discuss the various algorithms supported by Apache Spark to build statistical and machine learning applications. Through practical case-studies, we will discuss how these algorithms can be applied and scaled to address the big data challenges in the enterprise.</p> <p>Day 1</p> <p>On day one, we will begin with an introduction to Apache Spark. Through examples we will understand how to build applications using PySpark, the Python API for Spark. We will then focus on the MLLib API for building Machine Learning applications in Spark.</p> <p>What you will learn</p> <p>• Apache Spark: An introduction</p> <p>• Considerations for large Scale machine learning: How is it different from running algorithms on your laptop?</p> <p>• Basic Statistical techniques in Apache Spark</p> <p>• Machine Learning Techniques in Apache Spark: Clustering and Classification</p> <p>• Evaluating performance in machine learning algorithms</p> <p>• Case study 1: Clustering large financial assets with Apache Spark</p> <p>• Case study 2: Large Scale regression modeling with Apache Spark</p> <p>Day 2</p> <p>On day two, we will focus on building end-to-end applications with Apache Spark</p> <p>What you will learn</p> <p>• Feature Engineering with Spark: Feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection</p> <p>• Machine Learning Pipelines: Constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines</p> <p>• Deploying Machine Learning models: Tools and Best practices</p> <p>• Case study 3: Processing large datasets with Spark</p> <p>• Case study 4: An end-to-end machine learning application pipeline</p> <p>All applications will be built on the Data Science Experience platform, courtesy of our sponsors</p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/7/5/600_451581365.jpeg"" /></p> ","115200000","1374708662000","9505222","open","42.36000061035156","-71.05999755859375","Big Data Developers in Boston","Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston","Members","","234224624","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/234224624/","","Apache Spark Workshop: Core Statistics and Machine Learning Models","","","","past","1475499600000","1475616425000","-14400000","1 Rogers Street","","Cambridge","us","23817440","42.3664665222168","USA","-71.07735443115234","IBM Client Center","","False","MA","","public","0","33"
"13","1474467666000","<p>The goal of text classification is the classification of text documents into a fixed number of predefined categories. Text classification has a number of applications ranging from email spam detection to providing news feed content to users based on user preferences.</p> <p>In this session, we will explore how to perform text classification using Spark’s Machine Learning Library (MLlib). We will see how MLlib provides a set of high-level APIs for constructing, evaluating and tuning a machine learning workflow. We will explore how Spark represents a workflow as a pipeline, which consists of a sequence of stages to be run in a specific order. The pipeline for our text classification use case will utilize transformer stages to prepare the raw text documents for classification and estimator stages to learn a machine learning model that can be used to classify documents. Tuning the model for best fit will also be illustrated.</p> <p>In the session, we'll walk through a detailed demo of text classification running in a Spark notebook</p> <p>Although a document classification use case will be specifically explored, many of the principles demonstrated in the session can be employed in a variety of other machine learning use cases.</p> <p>There is no charge of this event.

The first is code reuse as essentially the same queries be run on batch, interactive or streaming data. Second, it simplifies streaming application development as you can operate on streams of data just like you can on static data using DataFrames. Structured Streaming abstracts away the complexity of streaming analytics allowing you to perform streaming analytics without having to reason about streaming.</p> <p>The Spark SQL engine takes care of running Structured Streaming queries and incrementally and continuously updating the result as streaming data continues to arrive. With Spark Structured Streaming, you can express streaming aggregations, event-time windows, as well as join streaming data to static data.</p> <p>In this session, we’ll walk through the basics of Structured Streaming, its programming model and APIs.
