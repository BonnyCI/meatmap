If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.<br/>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.</p> <p>That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.

• Open floor plan - The show floor will continue to follow an open floor plan again this year using our new architecture that enhances the overall EXPO experience and promotes attendee networking.  The Solution EXPO will continue to evolve from a traditional trade show into a destination where attendees want – and have a reason – to spend time during the event.</p> <p>

• Plus sponsorship packages - We will continue to offer a full-service experience via our Plus packages -- remember, these also afford you a premium location on the show floor.
