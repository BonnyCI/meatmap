My undergraduate degree is in \u2018Biochemistry\u2019 and having started programming computers aged eight I did my Masters degree in Bioinformatics because the overlap of the fields interested me. I\u2019ve worked in the Netherlands, my home country of the UK and in Canada on a range of topics in the field of Bioscience and medical research for the past few years. Most of these involved \u2018data munging\u2019 to interface pre-existing tools and packages to my own software or filtering strategies. Quite quickly I became interested in Data Management: better management = less munging &amp; better results with less pain.

Two topics will be covered:</p> <p><b>Topic 1: </b><br/>Semi-automated human genome annotation</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b><br/>Sequence census methods like ChIP-seq now produce an unprecedented amount of genome-anchored data. We have developed an integrative method to identify patterns from multiple experiments simultaneously while taking full advantage of high-resolution data, discovering joint patterns across different assay types. We apply this method to ENCODE chromatin data for multiple human cell types, including ChIP-seq data on covalent histone modifications and transcription factor binding, and DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq readouts of open chromatin. In an unsupervised fashion, we identify patterns associated with transcription start sites, gene ends, enhancers, CTCF elements, and repressed regions. The method yields a model which elucidates the relationship between assay observations and functional elements in the genome. This model identifies sequences likely to affect transcription, and we verify these predictions in laboratory experiments. We have made software and an integrative genome browser track freely available (<a href=\"http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/\"><a href=\"http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/\" class=\"linkified\">http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/</a></a>).</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><br/>Michael M. Hoffman (Assistant Professor in the Departments of Medical Biophysics and Computer Science, University of Toronto)</p> <p><b>Topic #2: </b><br/>Deep Autoencoder Neural Networks for Gene Ontology Annotation Predictions</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b><br/>The annotation of genomic information is a major challenge in biology and bioinformatics. Existing databases of known gene functions are incomplete and prone to errors, and the biomolecular experiments needed to improve these databases are slow and costly. While computational methods are not a substitute for experimental verification, they can help in two ways: algorithms can aid in the curation of gene annotations by automatically suggesting inaccuracies, and they can predict previously-unidentified gene functions, accelerating the rate of gene function discovery. In this work, we develop an algorithm that achieves both goals using deep autoencoder neural networks. With experiments on gene annotation data from the Gene Ontology project, we show that deep autoencoder networks achieve better performance than other standard machine learning methods, including the popular truncated singular value decomposition.</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><br/>Davide Chicco (postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto)</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 2}, {"created": 1429075051000, "id": "221856417", "name": "Big Data and Apache Hadoop - Just the Basics", "status": "past", "time": 1431036000000, "updated": 1432663839000, "utc_offset": -14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 190, "venue": {"id": 23813850, "name": "LoyaltyOne", "lat": 43.654361724853516, "lon": -79.38874053955078, "repinned": false, "address_1": "438 University Ave, Suite 1200", "city": "Toronto", "country": "ca", "localized_country_name": "Canada", "zip": "", "state": "ON"}, "group": {"created": 1374711411000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Toronto", "id": 9505562, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 43.65999984741211, "lon": -79.4000015258789, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto/events/221856417/", "description": "<p>This is a new thing we're gonna try.\u00a0</p> <p>Each time we do this meetup, we'll start with this Big Data and Hadoop Introductory session because we're getting new people all the time and we want a \"standard way\" to get them up to speed.\u00a0</p> <p>This will be a 1 hour session and content will be the same every time.\u00a0</p> <p>Immediately following these intro sessions, we'll dive deeper into a topic related to Big Data and Hadoop.</p> <p>If you're just getting started with Big Data, this session is for you.</p> ", "how_to_find_us": "12th Floor", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 43}, {"created": 1434248334000, "duration": 6300000, "id": "223230113", "name": "IBM | Spark - The start of something big in data & design (Web Conference Only))", "status": "past", "time": 1434420000000, "updated": 1434428596000, "utc_offset": -14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 84, "group": {"created": 1374711411000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Toronto", "id": 9505562, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 43.65999984741211, "lon": -79.4000015258789, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto/events/223230113/", "description": "<p><i><b>THIS IS A WEB CONFERENCE ONLY.\u00a0 TIME OF WEB CONFERENCE LOCALLY IS BASED ON LIVE-STREAM START - PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.\u00a0</p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine?
