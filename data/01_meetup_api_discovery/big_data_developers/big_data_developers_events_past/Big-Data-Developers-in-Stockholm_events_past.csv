"4","1473887662000","<p>Join us for some food, drinks, mingle and interesting Weather talk with Margriet on October 12. </p> <p>Weather is a source of fascination and endless conversation. When you combine weather data sets with twitter chatter about the weather, what kinds of surprising insights might you find? Are the weather sentiments on Twitter related to the actual weather and forecasts? </p> <p>This talk shows you how to <b>extract, combine, and analyze Twitter and weather feeds in Python, using Spark, Insight for Twitter, Weather Company Data for Bluemix and Watson Tone Analyser. </b>We will explore how to analyse this data in a Python notebook to draw insights into patterns and sentiment that may not otherwise be apparent. The talk covers how to:</p> <p>- Extract Twitter feeds daily and store them into Cloudant database. <br/>- Analyze the tweet sentiment using Watson Tone Analyzer.<br/>- Deploy Weather Company Data for Bluemix to collect daily weather data and load it into Hadoop.<br/>- Combine and analyze the stored data to understand correlations between sentiment and weather in a Python notebook using Spark and multivariate statistical methods. We’ll also use clustering algorithms to compare correlations between regions to find out if the English weather really is as bad as they say.</p> <p>This is a fun sample problem showing how you can combine and analyse large and small data sets to uncover trends and patterns. The techniques presented in this talk are applicable to a wide variety of questions. You can easily add or swap out data sources to extend or adapt the examples given. This session is recommended for anyone looking to widen their skill set in working with data, particularly in a cloud environment.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Margriet Groenendijk is a Developer Advocate at IBM Cloud Data Services. She is all about data: from storing, cleaning, and munging through to analysing and visualising. She has a passion for creating clear plots and models that tease new insights from diverse data sets using tools like Cloudant NoSQL databases, data warehouses, Spark, and Python notebooks. Her PhD work explored large datasets of carbon uptake by forests. As a Research Fellow, she analysed very large observational datasets and the output of global scale climate models. She has written several scientific articles and regularly presents her work at international conferences.

<a href=""https://youtu.be/1HjzkLRdP5k"" class=""embedded"">https://youtu.be/1HjzkLRdP5k</a></p> <p><b>IBM Data Science Experience (DSX)</b> is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to activate their insights. Data scientists can use the best of open source, tap into IBM's unique features, grow their capabilities, and share their successes.   </p> <p>One can use Python, R, or Scala in Jupyter Notebooks already connected to Spark. Or use RStudio to deliver the most widely used open-source R statistical computing environment.   </p> <p>In this meetup we will delve into IBM Data Science Experience, its core capabilities around community, notebooks, maker palette and projects.   </p> <p>We will also look into upcoming Watson Machine Learning for DSX.    </p> <p> We split the meetup in 2 sessions.    </p> <p> 1). Introduction and a demo session (around 1.5 hours) </p> <p> 2). Hands-on sessions with Notebooks and RStudio. In these two session we will take a problem statement and a data-set, and let participants write an R asset, and a Spark notebook, share data and results among the team. During this session we will cover basics of R and Spark and assist in solving the problem.
