If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

Spark 1.5 ships major pieces of Project Tungsten, an initiative focused on increasing Spark’s performance through several low-level architectural optimizations. The release also adds operational features for the streaming component, such as backpressure support. Another major theme of this release is data science: Spark 1.5 ships several new machine learning algorithms and utilities, and extends Spark’s new R API with distributed GLM.<br/>We will give a high level intro of the release, dive into Project Tungsten and Spark Streaming, and discuss future plans.</p> <p>Speakers:<br/>Tathagata Das, Patrick Wendell, Reynold Xin, Databricks<br/>Dean Wampler, Ph.D. (@deanwampler) leads the Big Data efforts at Typesafe, focusing on Spark, Mesos, Hadoop, Akka, and other tools.

He has held senior sales engineering and management positions at Rational Software, PureAtria, IBM, Appistry and Palamida. Throughout his career, he has enabled organizations to accelerate technology adoption by understanding their needs and providing just-in-time business solutions. As WANdisco Director of Product Management for Big Data, Brett works with partners, prospects, and customers to help them understand and evolve the requirements for enterprise-ready Hadoop. </p> <p>----------------</p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action. </p> <p>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components: </p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss <br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing <br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs. </p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark” </p> <p><br/>Big SQL 4.1. Presenters: </p> <p> Michael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM</p> <p> Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics. </p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources. </p> <p><b>PARKING</b></p> <p>Street parking in certain areas (across the street &amp; up to 2 blocks away) at 5pm is free.  Check the signs so as not to get booted! </p> <p>Garage parking is on Columbus Drive in the same building as HopsScotch.  They validate parking for $2.00 up to 4 hours. </p> ","10800000","1349980140000","5347552","open","40.77000045776367","-73.98999786376953","Big Data Developers in NYC","Big-Data-Developers-in-NYC","Developers","https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=286+Washington+St,+Jersey+City,+NJ,+us","226995075","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-NYC/events/226995075/","","Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud","","","","past","1449700200000","1457722209000","-18000000","286 Washington Street","","Jersey City","us","24226629","40.71782302856445","USA","-74.03630828857422","HopScotch","","False","NJ","","public","0","63"

Exponentially increasing amounts of data (Volume) need to be processed to yield correct actions (Veracity). These new analytics applications must also be flexible in terms of deployment - employing a combination of cloud and on-premise resources as required to meet the needs of the business.

Simulated sensor data will be pre-processed in a node.js cloud application, transported via TCP to an on-premise Apache Kafka messaging system over a secure gateway, and monitored and analyzed with a Spark Streaming application running on Hadoop.

However, without an understanding of which algorithms to choose and when to apply a technique, most machine learning efforts turn into trial and error experiments with conclusions like ""The algorithms don't work"" or ""Perhaps we should get more data"". </p> <p>In this workshop, we will focus on the key tenets of machine learning algorithms and how to choose an algorithm for a problem. Rather than just showing how to run experiments in R, Python or Apache Spark, we will provide an intuitive understanding to machine learning with just enough mathematics and basic statistics. </p> <p><br/><b>You will learn: </b><br/>• How do you differentiate Clustering, Classification and Prediction algorithms? • What are the key steps in running a machine learning algorithm?<br/>• How do you choose an algorithm for a specific goal?<br/>Where does exploratory data analysis and feature engineering fit into the picture? • Once you run an algorithm, how do you evaluate the performance of an algorithm?<br/>• Role of Spark and Deep Learning techniques in Machine Learning<br/>• Practical Case studies with fully functional code </p> <p><b>Day 1 </b><br/>On day one, we will review the core techniques in Machine Learning.
