Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Hadoop for the Map Reduce function which is commonly used by Data Scientists for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets.</p> <p>This meetup is targeted at Data scientists, developers, and anyone engaged with reporting and analytics.</p> <p>At this meetup we will delve deeper into this announcement and provide you with guidance and materials to get started on Spark.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>The event will start at 6:00pm sharp and conclude around 8:00pm</p> <p><b>6:00pm - 7:00pm</b></p> <p><b>- Recap of announcements made in San Francisco</b></p> <p><b> - IBM's Commitment to Spark</b></p> <p>• Benefits of Apache Spark<br/>• Demonstrations of common use cases for Spark<br/>• IBM's innovations for Big Data, hybrid architecture, and Open Data Platform (ODP)<br/>• Timeline for availability of Spark support in IBM's analytics platform</p> <p><b>- Helping you get started with Spark </b><br/>-- <a href=""https://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/spark-fundamentals/"">Spark education for free at Big Data University</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/databricks/sparkcamp-strata-ca-intro-to-apache-spark-with-handson-tutorials""> -- Getting a hands-on start to Spark today with access to trial Spark code.</a></p> <p><b>7:00pm - 8:00pm</b></p> <p><b>- Networking drinks and nibbles</b></p> ","7200000","1391793491000","12767092","open","-37.810001373291016","144.9600067138672","Big Data Developers in Melbourne","Big-Data-Developers-in-Melbourne","members","IBM Southgate Seminar Room - Level 13 - Enter from Podium level","223602011","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Melbourne/events/223602011/","","IBM's announcement to embed Apache® Spark™ into its Analytics platforms","","","","past","1437033600000","1437095895000","36000000","60 City Rd, 3006, VIC","","Southbank","au","14938482","-37.82106399536133","Australia","144.96609497070312","IBM","","False","","","public","0","79"
