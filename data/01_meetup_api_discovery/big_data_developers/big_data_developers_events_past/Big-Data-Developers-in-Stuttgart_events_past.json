But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that\u00b4s why \"In Silico Medicine\" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live\" class=\"embedded\">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1473941120000, "duration": 7200000, "id": "234144786", "name": "On ApacheSpark, Jupyter and TimeSeries Forecasting", "status": "past", "time": 1474563600000, "updated": 1474573155000, "utc_offset": 7200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 30, "venue": {"id": 24789333, "name": "Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Seminarraum 0.108 im Informatikgeb\u00e4ude V38", "lat": 48.74513244628906, "lon": 9.10642147064209, "repinned": false, "address_1": "Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 38", "city": "Stuttgart", "country": "de", "localized_country_name": "Germany"}, "group": {"created": 1400111102000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Stuttgart", "id": 14461062, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 48.790000915527344, "lon": 9.1899995803833, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Stuttgart", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Stuttgart/events/234144786/", "description": "<p>Agenda</p> <p>1.

A novel way of collecting and analyzing sleep pattern data - Tim Waizenegger (Uni Stuttgart)</b></p> <p>In this two-part presentation, I will first show a prototype IoT device that collects data on sleep patterns in a novel, non-intrusive way.\u00a0The data gets streamed to the Bluemix cloud platform, where I will show different ways of performing data exploration as well as real time analysis.\u00a0The goals will be to visualize sleep patterns and implement a sleep-cycle aware alarm clock.</p> ", "how_to_find_us": "Room: 0.108, ground floor", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 5}]
