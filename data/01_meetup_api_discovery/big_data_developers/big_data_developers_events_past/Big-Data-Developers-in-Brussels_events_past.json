A round of Spark and machine learning lightning talks will follow.</p> <p>Many resources are available for building basic recommendation models using Spark. But how does a practitioner go from the basics to creating an end-to-end machine learning system, including deployment and management of models for real-time serving? In this session, we\u2019ll demonstrate how to build such a system based on Spark ML and Elasticsearch. In particular, we\u2019ll focus on how to go from data ingestion to model training to a real-time predictive system.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>18:30 \u2013 Welcome, food and drink</p> <p>18:40 \u2013 Update on the preparation and workshops of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.denguehack.org/\">Data4Good Hackathon</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://datasciencebe.com/tag/philippe-van-impe/\">Philippe Van Impe</a>,\u00a0founder, European Data Innovation Hub and the\u00a0Brussels Data Science Community</p> <p>18:50 \u2013 Introduction:\u00a0<a href=\"https://spark-summit.org/eu-2016/speakers/berni-schiefer/\">Berni Schiefer</a>, IBM Fellow</p> <p>19:00 \u2013 Creating an end-to-end Recommender System with Spark ML:\u00a0<a href=\"https://spark-summit.org/eu-2016/speakers/nick-pentreath/\">Nick Pentreath</a>, principal engineer at the IBM Spark Technology Center, Apache Spark PMC member and author of Machine Learning with Spark, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfpuget\">Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Puget</a>, distinguished engineer at IBM and chief architect for IBM Analytics Solutions.</p> <p>19:45 \u2013 Lightning talks:\u00a010 minute Spark and machine learning discussions, including new projects from Belgium.
