Hardly anyone agrees on what good, clean tests look like, though; if your tests are a live specification of your codebase, don\u2019t they deserve the same care and attention as your production code?</p> <p>This talk focuses on how to keep your tests readable, simple and maintainable. Specifically we will discuss how the \u201cgiven-when-then\u201d pattern affects the way you factor your code, and showcase the remarkable differences between a sloppy specification and a well-factored one.</p> <p>Moderate experience with testing is expected; knowledge Scala might be helpful but is not required.</p> <p><b>Igor Dmitriev, Software Engineer @Very Good Group</b></p> <p>Topic: \u201cJDK changes behind the scenes\u201d</p> <p>We have been using Java 7 and 8 for a long time.

We will try to understand when non-blocking programming makes sense for you, and when old blocking world\u00a0is still good to use. During this talk, we will talk a bit about non-blocking features in popular web and application servers. In addition, we will dedicate some time to understanding basics and purpose of asynchronous framework Netty.</p> <p>About speaker: Yevhen has been in IT for 12+ years. Currently he holds the position of an expert in EPAM Java Competence Center, and is assigned as a Solution Architect to production projects. Yevhen has been involved into different projects in many business domains such as insurance, e-commerce, billing and logistics; has passion for following modern Java trends for building scalable, robust, highly available applications with focus on effective architecture.</p> <p><b>Maksym Bruner, Solution Architect @EPAM</b></p> <p><i>Topic: Using SonarQube as a code quality booster</i></p> <p>This topic will cover typical Sonar use cases:</p> <p>- how to start using it;</p> <p>- how to include sonar checks into build pipeline;</p> <p>- how to work with sonar rules sets, etc.</p> <p>Also, it will cover cases when you want to introduce Sonar in the middle or even at the end of your project.</p> <p>About speaker: 8+\u00a0years in\u00a0production software development (almost 5\u00a0years with EPAM), now working in\u00a0Java CC.

So do JUnit needs 11 years to get a new major release, which means it\u2019s going to be really huge. Milestone 3 is already available and GA is scheduled on Q3 2017, so now it\u2019s the best time to learn and discuss how automating testing is going to look like very soon. In this talk we will go through JUnit 5 changes and see how they will influence test code we write. Also we will discuss JUnit 5 architectural approach, how it can be extended and how it turns JUnit from test framework into test platform.</p> <p><i>Oleh Dokuka, @Levi 9<br/>Topic: \u201cProject Reactor\u201d<br/></i></p> <p>During the meetup, we are going to overview Project Reactor in depth and will try to understand how to use correctly given functionality and to rebuild imperative web application to reactive one:</p> <p>1.

Jenkins 2.0 with pipelines looks like a good option for that. But is it enough? Let\u2019s add Docker for containerization. We think it could be even better with Kubernetes. The presentation will provide you how to build CI for microservices from scratch with those tools and describes some best practices applicable for Microservices CI.</p> <p>About speaker: Andriy Trubitsyn is a hands-on architect passioned for microservices architecture style, who spent a lot of nights researching the topic. A person who drives a microservices accelerator in EPAM and consults about different aspects of microservices-related things.</p> <p><b>Roman Shramkov, Solution Architect @EPAM</b></p> <p>Topic: \u201cSolution Architecture, touching the base\u201d</p> <p>In this talk Roman will explain such interesting role as a Solution Architect and his place in big and technically complex projects.
