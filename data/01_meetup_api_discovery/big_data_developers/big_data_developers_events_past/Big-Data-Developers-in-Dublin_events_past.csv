At this meetup, we will explore the nature &amp; various flavours of unstructured data, the challenges it raises for the developers &amp; data scientist and its importance in the Big Data landscape. First, we will look at the ""semi-structured data"" field with an overview of JSON (one of its major representative), its use &amp; impact on both the relational &amp; NoSQL Big Data worlds, and what it means for the future of the industry and its practitionners. We will then dive into the area of free text, with a developer in the natural language processing field walking us through some of the technical opportunities, challenges &amp; solutions the it has to offer. </p> <p>

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.
