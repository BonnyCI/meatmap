If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine?

"41","1465397218000","<p>Apache <b>Spark </b>is an <b>open source </b>big data processing framework built around speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. First developed in 2009, Spark provides several advantages over other big data and MapReduce technologies. With Spark, Hadoop clusters can run up to 100 times faster in memory, and 10 times faster when running on disk. With the ability to write applications in Java, Scala or even Python, Spark is a flexible and powerful paradigm.</p> <p>With IBM's ""Open for Data"" cloud computing initiative, current and prospective users can provision an instance of Spark in the cloud in a matter of minutes without up-front infrastructure investment. The power of the cloud empowers users to scale up massively based on business needs. De-provisioning resources when those needs change is equally as agile, giving our users the best value for performance.</p> <p><br/>Please join us on <b>Tuesday</b>,<b> June 28</b>, 2016 at <b>12:00</b> noon as we discuss Spark both deployed as a service and on premise. After an introduction to Spark, we'll talk about how to decide if your project is well suited for processing in the cloud. Finally we'll perform a brief demonstration.
