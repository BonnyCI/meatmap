Join us and participate in an exclusive Big Data Developer Day hosted by the IBM Big Data team.   Open source Apache Hadoop is a great framework for distributed processing of large data sets. But there’s a difference between ""playing"" with big data versus solving real problems. The reality is that Hadoop alone might not be enough. Experience IBM’s <b>enterprise-class Hadoop</b> product, InfoSphere BigInsights, which enhances open source Hadoop with required enterprise capabilities including: analytics, visualization, security, standard SQL, enterprise HBase, developer/admin tools, learn about the role of <b>Big Data in Motion, Big Data Exploration</b> and more. The morning session will include interactive <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata/use-cases.html"">Big Data use case</a> discussions, an overview of what is big data, live demonstrations of key Big Data components (Big Data at Rest, Big Data in Motion).</p> <p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B27SpLOOhWw&amp;feature=player_embedded"" class=""embedded"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B27SpLOOhWw&amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p> <p><br/>and, in the afternoon, get hands-on with Big Data using <a href=""http://ibm.co/quickstart"">InfoSphere BigInsights Quick Start Edition</a> and <a href=""http://ibm.co/streamsqs"">InfoSphere Streams Quick Start Edition</a> with guidance from development experts. This is a unique opportunity to develop skills and learn about exciting technologies and techniques that you can immediately take back to your organization.</p> <p><b>This event is <i>FREE</i>.</b> Breakfast, Lunch and snacks will be provided.</p> <p>Agenda (subject to change)</p> <p>

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.
