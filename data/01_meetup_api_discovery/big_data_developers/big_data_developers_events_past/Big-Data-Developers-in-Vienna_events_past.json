But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that\u00b4s why \"In Silico Medicine\" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live\" class=\"embedded\">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1472502052000, "duration": 14400000, "id": "233719480", "name": "DataFirst Launch Event \u2013 Experience new ways to put your data to work", "status": "past", "time": 1474992000000, "updated": 1475009052000, "utc_offset": 7200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 7, "venue": {"id": 24745891, "name": "Hudson Mercantile Bldg", "lat": 40.755863189697266, "lon": -73.99864959716797, "repinned": false, "address_1": "500 West 36th Street", "city": "New York", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "NY"}, "group": {"created": 1400265324000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Vienna", "id": 14493632, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 48.220001220703125, "lon": 16.3700008392334, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna", "who": "Big Data Enthusiasts"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna/events/233719480/", "description": "<p>On September 27, 2016, leading minds in data and analytics will come together and unveil the latest in cloud technology, enabling you to more efficiently put data to work.
