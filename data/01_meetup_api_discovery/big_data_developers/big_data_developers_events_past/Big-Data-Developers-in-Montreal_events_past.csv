<b>CALLING ALL DEVELOPERS .... JOIN THE BIG DATA FOR SOCIAL GOOD CHALLENGE</b></p> <p>

Big data exists in just about everything we use and do. It comes from phones, cars, roads, power lines, waterways, food crates, and innumerable other items you’d never think of as computers. This data speaks volumes about our collective behavior and society – so let’s use it to do something incredible! IBM invites developers and data enthusiasts to take a deep dive into real world civic issues using big data and the IBM <a href=""https://console.ng.bluemix.net/"">Bluemix Analytics for Hadoop</a> service. Analyze one of our curated datasets or bring your own (provided it meets these requirements)! Use Hadoop and your data to create a clickable and interactive data visualization to highlight insights that you’ve found.</p> <p>

Ready to get started? $40,000 in prizes will be awarded....</p> <p>

Nous espérons vous rencontrer tous pour notre évènement inaugural à Montréal. Ce groupe s'addresse aux développeurs, statisticiens et à tous les enthousiastes et les praticiens du Big Data. Nos meetups offrent une opportunité d`apprendre les dernières nouveautés dans le domaine des technologies Big Data et, pour certaines sessions d`avoir une expérience pratique sur les solutions Big Data et les outils associés. Pour la premier évènement qui va démarrer cette communauté, la session va être consacrée aux concepts clés de Hadoop (HDFS, MapReduce, YARN, Spark...), ainsi qu'une revue rapide du riche écosystème des projets Apache Open Source autour de Hadoop (HBase, Hive, Pig, Sqoop, Flume...). Cette session d`introduction sera suivie d'une session plus courte consacrée à l`exploitation du langage R sur Hadoop avec BigR, un composant de la distribution Hadoop d'IBM BigInsights. Cette première session sur Hadoop est très accessible s'addresse principalement à une audience familière avec la problématique de l'analyse de données en entreprise,<br/>d'intelligence d'affaires et des sciences de données et qui souhaite raffermir leurs connaissances de base sur Hadoop au délà des ""buzz words"", et sera particulièrement bénéfique à ceux qui font leur premier saut sur Hadoop.</p> <p>- English:</p> <p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of the Big Data Developer Meetup community in Montreal!

Spark, qui est une plate-forme de traitement distribué de données, brille par sa performance, sa facilité d'utilisation, ainsi qu'un ensemble d'outils de plus haut niveau pour faciliter son usage. Grâce à son intégration sur Hadoop, Apache Spark s'impose de facto comme une alternative attractive par rapport à Map Reduce.</p> <p>Cette présentation sera dédiée à Spark, avec une revue de son architecture, ses composants, son fonctionnement ainsi que son intégration sur Hadoop.

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.
