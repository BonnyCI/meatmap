And very low latency to enable real time analytic processing.</p> <p>Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p> <p>This Meetup will provide an overview and comparison of many different contenders in the fast growing streaming analytics space, then show a demo of IBM Streams technology allowing programs written completely in Python to call Streams libraries, and then deploy those apps to the Streams runtime.</p> <p>Pizza and drinks will be served.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1472220884000, "duration": 7200000, "id": "233639857", "name": "IBM Watson Analytics LIVE! - Boston", "rsvp_limit": 20, "status": "past", "time": 1473969600000, "updated": 1473977832000, "utc_offset": -14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 20, "venue": {"id": 669000, "name": "Harpoon Brewery", "lat": 42.34806442260742, "lon": -71.03710174560547, "repinned": false, "address_1": "306 Northern Ave", "city": "Boston", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "phone": "1-888-HARPOON", "zip": "02210", "state": "MA"}, "group": {"created": 1470709415000, "name": "Boston Analytics Meetup", "id": 20295369, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 42.36000061035156, "lon": -71.06999969482422, "urlname": "Boston-Analytics-Meetup", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Analytics-Meetup/events/233639857/", "description": "<p><b>EVENT REGISTRATION IS FULL</b></p> <p><br/>You\u2019re invited to IBM Watson Analytics LIVE!</p> <p>Introducing IBM\u00ae Watson\u2122 Analytics Professional Edition.</p> <p>IBM Watson Analytics is a revolutionary smart data discovery service on the cloud that helps business people quickly discover patterns and meanings in their data\u2014all on their own.</p> <p>Please join us at Watson Analytics LIVE!, an event running in a city near you.
