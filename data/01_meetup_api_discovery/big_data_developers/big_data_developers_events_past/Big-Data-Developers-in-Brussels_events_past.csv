"1","1476900357000","<p>Join The Brussels Data Science Community, <a href=""https://spark-summit.org/eu-2016/"">Spark Summit Europe</a> attendees, and Spark ML and machine learning experts Nick Pentreath and Jean-Francois Puget for a talk on an Apache Spark–based, end-to-end machine learning system. A round of Spark and machine learning lightning talks will follow.</p> <p>Many resources are available for building basic recommendation models using Spark. But how does a practitioner go from the basics to creating an end-to-end machine learning system, including deployment and management of models for real-time serving? In this session, we’ll demonstrate how to build such a system based on Spark ML and Elasticsearch. In particular, we’ll focus on how to go from data ingestion to model training to a real-time predictive system.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>18:30 – Welcome, food and drink</p> <p>18:40 – Update on the preparation and workshops of the <a href=""http://www.denguehack.org/"">Data4Good Hackathon</a>, and <a href=""https://datasciencebe.com/tag/philippe-van-impe/"">Philippe Van Impe</a>, founder, European Data Innovation Hub and the Brussels Data Science Community</p> <p>18:50 – Introduction: <a href=""https://spark-summit.org/eu-2016/speakers/berni-schiefer/"">Berni Schiefer</a>, IBM Fellow</p> <p>19:00 – Creating an end-to-end Recommender System with Spark ML: <a href=""https://spark-summit.org/eu-2016/speakers/nick-pentreath/"">Nick Pentreath</a>, principal engineer at the IBM Spark Technology Center, Apache Spark PMC member and author of Machine Learning with Spark, and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfpuget"">Jean-François Puget</a>, distinguished engineer at IBM and chief architect for IBM Analytics Solutions.</p> <p>19:45 – Lightning talks: 10 minute Spark and machine learning discussions, including new projects from Belgium.
