Presenter: Benjamin Lumbert, Big Data Systems Engineer, IBM </b><br/>\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p><b>Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark \u2013 On-Premise or in the Cloud</b></p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion\u2014immediate response and action.</p> <p><br/>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:</p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss<br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing<br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.</p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the \u201cbest in class\u201d architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with \u201cContinuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark\u201d\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>BigSQL 4.1.\u00a0</b>\u00a0Presenter: Benjamin Lumbert, Big Data Systems Engineer, IBM</p> <p>\u00a0Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.</p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Parking</b></p> <p>-\u00a0 On-site valet $8 per car</p> ", "how_to_find_us": "Zip: 60607", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 2}, {"created": 1458925131000, "duration": 7200000, "id": "229868929", "name": "What is all the Hype about Apache Spark", "status": "past", "time": 1460070000000, "updated": 1460260298000, "utc_offset": -18000000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 103, "venue": {"id": 21132322, "name": "IBM Chicago Office", "lat": 41.88112258911133, "lon": -87.63666534423828, "repinned": false, "address_1": "71 S Wacker Drive 6th Floor", "city": "Chicago", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "IL"}, "group": {"created": 1355849621000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Chicago", "id": 6285502, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 41.880001068115234, "lon": -87.63999938964844, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Chicago", "who": "Developers"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Chicago/events/229868929/", "description": "<p>Come learn more about Apache Spark.
