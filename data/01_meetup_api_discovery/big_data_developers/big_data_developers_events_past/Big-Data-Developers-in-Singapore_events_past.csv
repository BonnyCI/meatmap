"4","1434339354000","<p>THIS IS A WEB CONFERENCE ONLY.  TIME OF WEB CONFERENCE LOCALLY IS BASED ON LIVE-STREAM START - PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME. DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW. </p> <p><br/>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.</p> <p><br/>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.</p> <p>That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value. On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

He is one of the top committers in the open source community of Tachyon project. Prior to Tachyon Nexus, he worked in Google to build the next-generation storage infrastructure and won Google's Technical Infrastructure award.  Bin had publication in most prestigious acadmic conferences in Computer Science including SIGCOMM, SOSP, NSDI, and got his PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University</p> <p>Title: Introduction to Memory-centric Distributed Storage System Tachyon and Its Use Case</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Memory is the key to fast Big Data processing. This has been realized by many, and frameworks such as Spark and Shark already leverage memory performance. As data sets continue to grow, storage is increasingly becoming a critical bottleneck in many workloads.</p> <p>To address this need, we have developed Tachyon, a memory centric fault-tolerant distributed file system, which enables reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce. Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Different from traditional replication scheme, Tachyon achieves fault-tolerance by leveraging lineage information.</p> <p>Over two years of research and production deployment, Tachyon as an open-source system has more than 160 contributors from over 50 institutions, including IBM, Yahoo, Intel, Redhat, Baidu, and Tachyon Nexus. We had a major release, version 0.8 in October 2015, including numerous new features. In particular, the latest version support mounting of multiple under storage systems and transparent naming enables more exciting use cases for Tachyon users,  remote write to allow users to write to Tachyon through remote workers, detailed monitoring of the master and workers, and integration with Yarn and Mesos. In the presentation, we will also explore several potential industry use cases enabled by the new features. </p> <p>============= </p> <p>Speaker:  <b>Kostas Sakellis</b> is a Software Engineer and contributor to Apache Spark. Previous to that, he contributed to the extensibility effort on Cloudera Manager. Before Cloudera, Kostas did a 6 year stint at Amazon working across various teams including platform infrastructure. Kostas has a Bachelors of Mathematics in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo.</p> <p><br/>Title: Apache Spark 101: Taming Big Data</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Apache Spark has become a very popular data processing framework due to its speed and easy of use. In this talk we will start at the beginning and give a brief technical introduction to key Spark concepts and differentiators. We will dive deep into the core architecture of Spark and discuss improvements over MapReduce. We will conclude with a few examples of Spark being used to solve real world problems. </p> <p>=============</p> ","","1391781826000","12764782","open","1.2999999523162842","103.8499984741211","Big Data Developers in Singapore","Big-Data-Developers-in-Singapore","Members","Room 321/322","226995364","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Singapore/events/226995364/","","December Meetup during Strata!","","","","past","1448965800000","1448984089000","28800000","#1 Raffles Blvd","","Suntec City","sg","24226661","1.3520829677581787","Singapore","103.81983947753906","Suntec Convention & Exhibition Center","","False","","","public","0","71"
