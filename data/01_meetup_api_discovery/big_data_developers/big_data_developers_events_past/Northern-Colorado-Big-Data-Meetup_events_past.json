The good news is that there\u2019s an abundance of materials \u2013 books, web sites, conferences, etc. \u2013 for gaining a deep understanding of Hadoop and these related projects. The bad news is there\u2019s still a scarcity of information on how to integrate these components to implement complete solutions. In this tutorial we\u2019ll walk through an end-to-end case study of a clickstream analytics engine to provide a concrete example of how to architect and implement a complete solution with Hadoop. We\u2019ll use this example to illustrate important topics such as:</p> <p>\u2022 Modeling data in Hadoop and selecting optimal storage formats for data stored in Hadoop</p> <p>\u2022 Moving data between Hadoop and external data management systems such as relational databases</p> <p>\u2022 Moving event-based data such as logs and machine generated data into Hadoop</p> <p>\u2022 Accessing and processing data in Hadoop</p> <p>\u2022 Orchestrating and scheduling workflows on Hadoop</p> <p>Throughout the example, best practices and considerations for architecting applications on Hadoop will be covered. This talk will be valuable for developers, architects, or project leads who are already knowledgeable about Hadoop, and are now looking for more insight into how it can be leveraged to implement real-world applications.</p> <p><b>Biography:</b></p> <p>Mark Grover is a co-author of O'Reilly Hadoop Application Architectures.
