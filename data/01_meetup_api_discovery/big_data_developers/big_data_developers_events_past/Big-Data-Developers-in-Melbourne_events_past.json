Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Hadoop for the Map Reduce function which is commonly used by Data Scientists for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.
