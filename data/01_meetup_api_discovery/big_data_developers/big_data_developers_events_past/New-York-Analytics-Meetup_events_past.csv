"0","1474663172000","<p><b>Text Classification using Apache Spark Machine Learning Webinar </b></p> <p>In this session, we will explore how to perform text classification using Spark’s Machine Learning Library (MLlib). We will see how MLlib provides a set of high-level APIs for constructing, evaluating and tuning a machine learning workflow. We will explore how Spark represents a workflow as a Pipeline, which consists of a sequence of stages to be run in a specific order. The Pipeline for our text classification use case will utilize Transformer stages to prepare the raw text documents for classification and Estimator stages to learn a machine learning model that can be used to classify documents. Finally, we will illustrate how to tune the model for best fit. </p> <p><b>Where: </b> Webinar – October 19th, 2016 Time: 12:00 to 1:00 pm EST</p> <p><b>RSVP: </b> <a href=""http://bit.ly/2d6brlA""><a href=""http://bit.ly/2d6brlA"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2d6brlA</a></a> We look forward to having you join us!</p> <p>To receive additional information about hands-on trainings, webinars, and meetups, signup at <a href=""http://ibm.biz/datagurus""><a href=""http://ibm.biz/datagurus"" class=""linkified"">http://ibm.biz/datagurus</a></a></p> ","3600000","1470632305000","20291402","open","40.75","-73.98999786376953","New York Analytics Meetup","New-York-Analytics-Meetup","Members","http://bit.ly/2d6brlA","234357654","https://www.meetup.com/New-York-Analytics-Meetup/events/234357654/","","Learn How to Use Spark Machine Learning (Webinar)","","","","past","1476892800000","1476897742000","-14400000","Online via your computer","","New York","us","23481766","40.78200149536133","USA","-73.83350372314453","This Class will be taught online, using your computer with high speed internet","","False","NY","","public","0","58"
