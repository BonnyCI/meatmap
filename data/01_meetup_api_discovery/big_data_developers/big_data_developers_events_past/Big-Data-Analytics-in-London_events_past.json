They represent data as \u2018vertices\u2019, sometimes called \u2018nodes\u2019. The relationships between vertices are represented by connections called \u2018edges\u2019. Graph databases also store metadata or \u2018properties\u2019 about vertices and edges. Graph database applications came to prominence when modeling complex networks of related data, include modelling and applying social networks, constructing and developing recommendation engines, and \u2018optimal route\u2019 challenges such as finding the shortest path or solving the vehicle routing problem. In this session you'll learn how you can get started with IBM Graph to analyse your data.</p> <p><a href=\"https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/mike-elsmore\"> </a></p> <p><b>Mike Elsmore</b> spends his days as Developer Advocate at IBM Cloud Data Services, using his time to share knowledge on rapid development and different databases.

In this third lecture we will discuss various assumptions in linear regression models and how to validate them. We will look at high-order polynomial curves and how we can use them to capture curvilinear relationships. We will also introduce the holdout method and k-fold cross validation for estimating the generalisation of the models to unseen data.</p> <p><b>Please note:</b> If you haven't attended the first two lectures in the series, there is a recording available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKryvmknjpgPLh3kS_t1_Z1DlmcYPlQhZ\">YouTube</a>.

But it all starts with having access to the data. I will walk your through some examples of how to collect, store and access data in the Cloud with the use of different APIs:</p> <p>- Store Twitter and weather data in a NoSQL database (Cloudant) and enrich the data with sentiment using Watson</p> <p>- Collect and store daily weather observations</p> <p>- Access this data in a Jupyter notebook using Python, Pandas and Spark</p> <p>- Real time Twitter sentiment in a Jupyter notebook using the <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/2016/10/11/pixiedust-magic-for-python-notebook/\">PixieDust</a></p> <p>\n\nMargriet Groenendijk is a Developer Advocate at IBM Cloud Data Services.

IPython notebook is an established tool in the Data Science community and embedding the application's Spark Context within it, can speed up development and limit errors. One possible usage model is to share a set of precomputed RDDs cached in Spark's cluster memory between multiple users. This approach reduces the resource usage, since the precomputation happens only once and the cached data is not replicated for each user. Sharing SQL contexts allows instantaneous access to temporary results by other users. We\u2019ll conclude the session with presenting how this solution helped to bring interactive notebooks into our flagship Big Data processing platform: Seahorse.</p> <p>Piotr \u0141usakowsk, Technical Leader, deepsense.io</p> <p>Piotr graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics at University of Warsaw.

The packed schedule presented a challenge to Wimbledon, in vying for sports fans attention, but also an opportunity to draw in fans from other sports. In order to make their own editorial content relevant, Wimbledon needed to understand what tennis and general sports fans were talking about and where their interests lay.</p> <p>The Cognitive Social Command Centre (CSCC) used IBM's Watson technology &amp; the Spark platform to identify, in real-time, emerging topics of conversation around Wimbledon and the other sports events. It highlighted which of those topics had the potential to perform best and what content was being engaged with now. By using a Cognitive solution that was trained not programmed, the system was continually improving throughout the Championships, learning what was being said about Wimbledon and the other sporting events.</p> <p>Adelina Balasa, Technical Consultant, IBM Cloud</p> <p><br/>Adelina has been with IBM for 3 years and during this time she\u2019s developed a very broad set of skills, from technical expertise to project management to creative work.

Willem Hendrik will start with the basics and hopefully get everybody enthusiastic about this emerging technology. He will then demonstrate a step by step method that will enable you to start building and training networks.</p> <p><i>Willem Hendriks</i> studied Mathematics at TU Delft (the Netherlands). He is currently undertaking various Big Data related projects at IBM, as a data scientist</p> <p><b>Using Deep Learning to Design the Molecules of Tomorrow </b></p> <p>In theory, there are more potential stable molecules than there are atoms in the universe. So how do we find new molecules for the drugs, materials, additives (etc) of the future? High-throughput virtual screening now allows us to scan millions of molecules, but this is still many orders of magnitude too small. The use of deep learning can both accelerate our search by speeding up (for example) property calculations, and by moving us towards an intelligent means of searching this vast space. I will introduce various types of neural network, and show how you can use them to speed up search problems by coupling them with a state of the art technique called Bayesian Optimization.</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/edward-pyzer-knapp\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; <i>Edward Pyzer-Knapp</i> obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge using simulation-based techniques to help guide experimental materials design. He then moved to Harvard where he was in charge of the day-to-day running of the Harvard Clean Energy project, which was a collaboration with IBM which combined massive distributed computing, quantum-mechanical simulations, and machine-learning to accelerate discovery of the next generation of organic photovoltaic materials. Now, Edward works for IBM Research UK, leading the large-scale machine learning research effort with a specific interest in bringing cutting edge techniques from machine learning and data science to the physical and life sciences.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 16}, {"created": 1493316037000, "duration": 7200000, "id": "239544567", "name": "Cognitive IoT using DeepLearning on ApacheSpark", "status": "past", "time": 1494439200000, "updated": 1494489485000, "utc_offset": 3600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 170, "venue": {"id": 24850649, "name": "SHACK15 : The Data Science Hub", "lat": 51.524559020996094, "lon": -0.07700800150632858, "repinned": false, "address_1": "67-71 Shoreditch High St,", "city": "London", "country": "gb", "localized_country_name": "United Kingdom"}, "group": {"created": 1374780559000, "name": "Big Data Developers in London", "id": 9516272, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 51.5099983215332, "lon": -0.07999999821186066, "urlname": "Big-Data-Analytics-in-London", "who": "Data Mashers"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Analytics-in-London/events/239544567/", "description": "<p>We have another bonus meetup for you next month.</p> <p><br/>Romeo Kienzler will be speaking at this year's <a href=\"http://www.devoxx.co.uk/\">Devoxx UK</a> developer community conference, and the evening before this event starts he will be hosting this meetup in London (venue to be confirmed shortly).</p> <p><br/>(By the way, if you are going to be at Devoxx UK yourself, come and find the IBM \"Mad Scientist Zone\" where our developers will be showing off some cool demos!)</p> <p>Session Abstract:</p> <p><br/>DeepLearning frameworks are popping up at very high frequency but only a few of them are suitable to run on clusters, use GPUs and supporting topologies beyond Feed-Forward at the same time.
