As the Chief Evangelist for Apache Cassandra and consultant for DataStax, he has helped build some of the largest deployments in the world. Previous to DataStax, he was Chief Architect at Hobsons, an education services company. There, he spoke often on Web Application design and performance.</p> <p>Synopsis: Apache Cassandra has proven to be one of the best solutions for storing and retrieving time series data at high velocity and high volume. This talk will discuss how the storage model of Cassandra is ideal for time series use cases and go over examples of how to best build data models. We will also cover pairing Apache Spark with Apache Cassandra to create a real time data analytics platform. Attendees will leave this session knowing how to build their own real time data analytics platform, and will be shocked at how easy it is!</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 3}, {"created": 1424337531000, "id": "220621441", "name": "Big Data, Munich v2.0", "status": "past", "time": 1424368800000, "updated": 1424381337000, "utc_offset": 3600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 19, "venue": {"id": 18008532, "name": "Event space at WERK1", "lat": 48.12443542480469, "lon": 11.607304573059082, "repinned": false, "address_1": "Grafinger Stra\u00dfe 6", "city": "M\u00fcnchen", "country": "de", "localized_country_name": "Germany"}, "group": {"created": 1400181332000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Munich", "id": 14476282, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 48.13999938964844, "lon": 11.579999923706055, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/220621441/", "description": "<p>7:00 - 7:20 PM: Networking 7:20 - 7:40 PM: Sammie Walden, Data Center/Cloud Solutions Specialist at CISCO Systems \"Big Data in Openstack Based Private Cloud\" 7:40 - 8:00 PM: Johannes Meier, Solution Engineer at Exasol</p> <p>\"Big Data - So What? - why Big Data matters to everyone\"</p> <p>8:00 - 8:20 PM: Martin Klimmek from Siemens (Mobility Data Services)</p> <p>\"Robust Data\"</p> <p>8:20 - 10:00 PM: Networking</p> <p>This Meetup is organized by our partner meetup so I recommend to RSVP there as well</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Munich/events/218617949/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Munich/events/218617949/</a></p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1415734746000, "id": "218620877", "name": "Big Data for Social Good Challenge (See Details for Start/End)", "status": "past", "time": 1425420000000, "updated": 1425432055000, "utc_offset": 3600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 35, "venue": {"id": 23442562, "name": "Big Data for Social Good Challenge", "lat": 33.86000061035156, "lon": -84.4000015258789, "repinned": false, "address_1": "Web only", "city": "Global", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "GA"}, "group": {"created": 1400181332000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Munich", "id": 14476282, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 48.13999938964844, "lon": 11.579999923706055, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/218620877/", "description": "<p><i><b>THE BIG DATA FOR SOCIAL GOOD CHALLENGE BEGINS NOVEMBER 10, 2014 AND CONTINUES TO MARCH 3, 2015.\u00a0</b></i></p> <p><b>CALLING ALL DEVELOPERS ....

Flink is one of the most active big data projects in the Apache Software Foundation and has more than 100 contributors. The core of Flink is a distributed stream processing engine that enables low-latency and high throughput data processing. Flink has high-level APIs for both stream and batch processing.<br/>In the first part of this talk we will briefly look at the history of Flink and then present the APIs and different use cases. Here we will also see how it can be deployed in practice.<br/>In the second part, we will look at the streaming execution engine that powers Flink. Here we will see what makes it tick and also what distinguishes it from other approaches, such as the mini-batch execution model. We will cover Flink's architecture and design decisions that result in Flink's unique set of features.</p> <p><i>Feeding a Squirrel in Time -- Windows in Apache Flink\u00a0</i></p> <p>In data stream processing, the dimension of time is a crucial aspect with regard to runtime effects as well as query semantics. There are two different time concepts: event-time also called occurrence time, ie, the time in which an event happens in the real world, and processing-time, ie, the time in which an events gets processed by the system. Both time dimensions deliver different semantics if used to specify windows on a data stream.<br/>In this talk, we give an introduction to time-base data stream<br/>processing and cover Flink's approach to handle windowing. Flink offers a broad range of (non-/)deterministic count-, time-, and custom-windows while offering a simple API to express those.</p> <p>Please note that this event has also been posted here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/</a></a></p> <p>We would like to thank our host Inovex GmbH for providing the location, food and drinks.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 1}, {"created": 1462126956000, "duration": 14400000, "id": "230792364", "name": "Apache Spark Maker Community Event", "status": "past", "time": 1465227000000, "updated": 1465244772000, "utc_offset": 7200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 25, "venue": {"id": 24126294, "name": "Galvanize U", "lat": 37.78749465942383, "lon": -122.39653015136719, "repinned": false, "address_1": "44 Tehama Street", "city": "San Francisco", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "CA"}, "group": {"created": 1400181332000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Munich", "id": 14476282, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 48.13999938964844, "lon": 11.579999923706055, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/230792364/", "description": "<p><i><b>THIS MEETUP AND LIVE STREAMING IS US PACIFIC STANDARD TIME (PST).

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that\u00b4s why \"In Silico Medicine\" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live\" class=\"embedded\">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1472499634000, "duration": 14400000, "id": "233718457", "name": "DataFirst Launch Event \u2013 Experience new ways to put your data to work", "status": "past", "time": 1474992000000, "updated": 1475009051000, "utc_offset": 7200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 11, "venue": {"id": 24745891, "name": "Hudson Mercantile Bldg", "lat": 40.755863189697266, "lon": -73.99864959716797, "repinned": false, "address_1": "500 West 36th Street", "city": "New York", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "NY"}, "group": {"created": 1400181332000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Munich", "id": 14476282, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 48.13999938964844, "lon": 11.579999923706055, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/233718457/", "description": "<p>On September 27, 2016, leading minds in data and analytics will come together and unveil the latest in cloud technology, enabling you to more efficiently put data to work.
