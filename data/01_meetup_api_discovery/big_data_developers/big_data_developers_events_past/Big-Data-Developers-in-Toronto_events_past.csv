<b>Biography of the speaker (in his own words):</b></p> <p>

Michael Moorhouse<br/>I’m a Bioinformatician – a mixture of Biology, computer science and mathematics. My undergraduate degree is in ‘Biochemistry’ and having started programming computers aged eight I did my Masters degree in Bioinformatics because the overlap of the fields interested me. I’ve worked in the Netherlands, my home country of the UK and in Canada on a range of topics in the field of Bioscience and medical research for the past few years. Most of these involved ‘data munging’ to interface pre-existing tools and packages to my own software or filtering strategies. Quite quickly I became interested in Data Management: better management = less munging &amp; better results with less pain. I have spent a lot of my time more recently assisting with the storage, transfer and security of the newer ‘Genomics’ data – specifically resulting from High Throughput DNA Sequencing - between international databases or consortia. My current roll is that of ‘Automation Engineer’ – aka. ‘Data Manager’ – at the OICR. Here I and the team are responsible safe and secure keeping of ~2 PB of data with a typical data set being in the ~20-50TB range</p> ","","1374711411000","9505562","open","43.65999984741211","-79.4000015258789","Big Data Developers in Toronto","Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto","Members","","220304792","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto/events/220304792/","","Managing & Processing Big Data for Cancer Genomics, an insight of Bioinformatics","","","","past","1423782000000","1424206308000","-18000000","120 Bloor Street East","","Toronto","ca","19046962","43.67129898071289","Canada","-79.38381958007812","IBM Centre for Solution Innovation","","False","ON","","public","0","74"

"2","1425318634000","<p>This meetup has been set up in support of our friends at IEEE Toronto. Two topics will be covered:</p> <p><b>Topic 1: </b><br/>Semi-automated human genome annotation</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b><br/>Sequence census methods like ChIP-seq now produce an unprecedented amount of genome-anchored data. We have developed an integrative method to identify patterns from multiple experiments simultaneously while taking full advantage of high-resolution data, discovering joint patterns across different assay types. We apply this method to ENCODE chromatin data for multiple human cell types, including ChIP-seq data on covalent histone modifications and transcription factor binding, and DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq readouts of open chromatin. In an unsupervised fashion, we identify patterns associated with transcription start sites, gene ends, enhancers, CTCF elements, and repressed regions. The method yields a model which elucidates the relationship between assay observations and functional elements in the genome. This model identifies sequences likely to affect transcription, and we verify these predictions in laboratory experiments. We have made software and an integrative genome browser track freely available (<a href=""http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/""><a href=""http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/"" class=""linkified"">http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/</a></a>).</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><br/>Michael M. Hoffman (Assistant Professor in the Departments of Medical Biophysics and Computer Science, University of Toronto)</p> <p><b>Topic #2: </b><br/>Deep Autoencoder Neural Networks for Gene Ontology Annotation Predictions</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b><br/>The annotation of genomic information is a major challenge in biology and bioinformatics. Existing databases of known gene functions are incomplete and prone to errors, and the biomolecular experiments needed to improve these databases are slow and costly. While computational methods are not a substitute for experimental verification, they can help in two ways: algorithms can aid in the curation of gene annotations by automatically suggesting inaccuracies, and they can predict previously-unidentified gene functions, accelerating the rate of gene function discovery. In this work, we develop an algorithm that achieves both goals using deep autoencoder neural networks. With experiments on gene annotation data from the Gene Ontology project, we show that deep autoencoder networks achieve better performance than other standard machine learning methods, including the popular truncated singular value decomposition.</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><br/>Davide Chicco (postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto)</p> ","","1374711411000","9505562","open","43.65999984741211","-79.4000015258789","Big Data Developers in Toronto","Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto","Members","","220871450","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto/events/220871450/","","Semi-automated human genome annotation","","","","past","1425934800000","1426010849000","-14400000","101 College Street ","","Toronto","ca","23640357","43.6598014831543","Canada","-79.38874816894531","Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Medical Discovery Tower, 4th floor, room 4-204","","False","ON","","public","0","35"
