"0","1427949449000","<p>In this inaugural MeetUp we will present for discussion a couple of topics on the benefit of NOSQL to the Banking and Finance sector. </p> <p>After an introduction to the MarkLogic NOSQL platform, our sponsors, we will present…</p> <p><b>“How NOSQL Can Address Record Retention and Compliance Challenges in the Banking and Finance Sectors”</b>. New online interaction channels are producing massive amounts of data and regulators are demanding the archiving of…everything! How do you query across all these records? And how do you not go broke in doing so?</p> <p><b>“Schema on Read in Financial Services”</b>. To meet regulatory requirements whilst undergoing extensive cost reduction programs, Financial Services Organizations need disruptive technologies to centrally store their data and provide real time and batch cross-asset views whilst maintaining the integrity of the source system format. Learn how MarkLogic excels in the role of trade and reference data hub absorbing multiple varieties of source data formats “as is” and dynamically transforming them to meet the expectations of multiple client applications.</p> <p>Our guest presenter will be Rupert Brown, Chief Technology Officer, Banking and Finance, MarkLogic.</p> <p>Contact on the evening is Sue Landers, Regional Manager Australia &amp; New Zealand.  0410 563 211</p> <p><br/>We will be serving drinks and a light snack.</p> ","5400000","1427687627000","18525544","open","-33.869998931884766","151.2100067138672","Sydney MarkLogic NoSQL MeetUp","Sydney-MarkLogic-NoSQL-MeetUp","members","The York.

"1","1428637124000","<p>Hi, all.</p> <p>Please lock in this date for the 2nd <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-MarkLogic-NOSQL-MeetUp/"">Sydney MarkLogic NOSQL MeetUp</a>.</p> <p><br/>Two topics at this session:</p> <p><b>1. Making Hadoop Better with NoSQL.</b></p> <p>Hadoop has become popular because it is designed to cheaply store that data in the Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) and run large-scale MapReduce jobs for batch analysis. However Hadoop is not designed for low latency transactions required for real-time interactive applications, or applications that require enterprise features such as government-grade security and high availability and disaster recovery. Even as the Hadoop ecosystem continues to evolve, the real benefits of Hadoop are enhanced when running alongside an enterprise-grade database.</p> <p>



<b>2. The Requirements of an Enterprise NoSQL platform.</b></p> <p><br/>As more and more businesses look towards NoSQL as providing a better platform choice over traditional RDBMS to support business agility, they soon discover a myriad of offerings all pro-porting to deliver on Big Data challenges. However, quite soon small pilots evolve and developers being to encounter coding complexity as they attempt resolve lacking database features which they take for granted from their mature enterprise RDBMS equivalents. <br/>We will discuss the common enterprise feature challenges and what differentiates an Enterprise NoSQL platform to highlight the pitfalls and considerations of new deployments.</p> <p>

"0","1434938862000","<p>Hi all,</p> <p>this month we will be co-hosting our MeetUp with the  ""Big Data for the Banking &amp; Finance sector"" Meetup group, for a ""NoSQL"" / ""Big Data"" themed event.</p> <p><br/>This July, we are privileged to have presentations from two thought leaders in security, suspicious activity monitoring and intelligence analysis. Drawing from real-world cases, they will each present a 30-minute thought provoking session on the trends in this fascinating and rapidly evolving area of technology.</p> <p><br/>""Organisations of all types need to observe behavior, activities, and other changing information over time – and generate actionable intelligence that lets them intervene to keep their customers, the public, or their businesses safe from harm.</p> <p><br/>• Law enforcement organizations perform suspicious activity monitoring as a foundational part of police and detective work</p> <p><br/>• Financial services institutions improve oversight with “know your customer” (KYC), anti-money-laundering, and trader surveillance initiatives</p> <p><br/>• National defence and security agencies “connect the dots” in disparate data to prevent terrorist attacks</p> <p><br/>• Healthcare and insurance organizations look for potential claims fraud</p> <p><br/>• Nearly every industry has teams focusing on cyber-crime and cyber-defence</p> <p><br/>In all cases, it is crucial to integrate data from a variety of heterogeneous sources – as fast as possible – and provide alerts on unusual activities to the people who need to know and respond. Join us as we discuss how to address this imperative.""</p> <p><br/>Our presenters will be Billy Sokol and James Clippinger.</p> <p><br/>Billy is an industry expert and thought leader in data management, program leadership, solution design, analysis and business process reengineering for defense, security and public safety and has worked with dozens of agencies in over ten countries. He has over 20 years in enterprise technology delivery and management, with deep experience in defense, security &amp; and public safety.</p> <p><br/>James Clippinger is the Director of Global Technical Services at MarkLogic. James has served as chief data engineer on several US government projects. Prior to MarkLogic, James was a senior search architect at Verity and Autonomy and a consultant at Hamiltonian Solutions. As part of his graduate research at Dartmouth College, he designed algorithms for parallel disk systems, implemented code for optimal parallel fast Fourier transforms, and researched parallel software optimization with Sun Microsystems’ HPC group.</p> <p><br/>I hope you can join us for these presentations from two extremely knowledgeable experts on this fascinating and highly relevant topic.</p> <p>Complementary food and drinks will be served. </p> ","9000000","1427687627000","18525544","open","-33.869998931884766","151.2100067138672","Sydney MarkLogic NoSQL MeetUp","Sydney-MarkLogic-NoSQL-MeetUp","members","","223406527","https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-MarkLogic-NoSQL-MeetUp/events/223406527/","","Data Sharing for the Paranoid - What Financial Services is learning from Govt","","","","past","1436254200000","1436264165000","36000000","Level 2, 99 York St, Sydney ","","Sydney","au","23766434","-33.87015914916992","Australia","151.205810546875","York Conference and Function Centre","","False","","","public","0","7"
"1","1456274409000","<p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>This month's meet up will include presentations from two NoSQL experts.</p> <p>Daniel Holgate, a Senior Sales Engineer at MarkLogic Australia, will be presenting on building a demo with NoSQL in just 15 minutes.   </p> <p>Watch us build a live prototype using MarkLogic, combining structured and unstructured data in ways you’ve never seen before to get more insight and discovery. Along the way we'll talk about how Enterprise NoSQL can solve your most difficult data problems. </p> <p>In the next session, Jason Hunter, MarkLogic's CTO for Asia-Pacific, will explain how MarkLogic works on the inside.</p> <p>How can MarkLogic do what it does? What black magic lets an Enterprise NoSQL database like MarkLogic load a variety of XML and JSON data with different schemas, then run super fast ad hoc queries against the data without having to know in advance either the shape of the data or the style of the queries? It seems completely impossible, but it's real, its not even that complicated, and yet it fundamentally changes the game for databases.</p> <p>I hope you can join us for these presentations from two extremely knowledgeable experts on this fascinating and highly relevant topic.</p> <p>Complementary food and drinks will be served. </p> <p>The doors will open at 6 pm for a 6:30 pm start time.</p> ","8100000","1427687627000","18525544","open","-33.869998931884766","151.2100067138672","Sydney MarkLogic NoSQL MeetUp","Sydney-MarkLogic-NoSQL-MeetUp","members","","229081983","https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-MarkLogic-NoSQL-MeetUp/events/229081983/","","Everything You Wanted To Know About MarkLogic, But Were Too Afraid To Ask","","","","past","1457420400000","1457494640000","39600000","Level 2, 99 York St, Sydney ","","Sydney","au","23766434","-33.87015914916992","Australia","151.205810546875","York Conference and Function Centre","","False","","","public","0","16"
