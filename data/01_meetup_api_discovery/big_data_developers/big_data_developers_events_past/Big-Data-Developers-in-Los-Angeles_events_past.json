If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.\u00a0</p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine?

The Spark Summit in last year had only about 500 attendees, for this year, the summit had more than 2000 attendees with many good use cases presented. More info about this summit is available at <a href=\"https://spark-summit.org/2015/\"><a href=\"https://spark-summit.org/2015/\" class=\"linkified\">https://spark-summit.org/2015/</a></a> .</p> <p>The Chief Information Officer from the Central Intelligence Agency, Doug Wolfe, also spoke at the Spark summit, about open data and about adopting big data technologies in government. It seems Spark could be very useful to process all the open data available, and I was told some venture capital funds have been created specially for the open data and public sector analytics, with the $100 Million SineWave Venture Fund as one example.</p> <p>And as announced at the Spark summit, IBM made a huge commitment to Spark, with a Spark Technology Center to be established in San Francisco that IBM will put thousands of data scientists and researchers into Spark development and has already made the IBM machine learning package, SystemML, open source to be integrated into Spark.
