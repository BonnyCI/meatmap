Join us for a hands-on technical session to learn all about the key capabilities in the IBM Big Data and Analytics portfolio. We will also feature Watson Analytics, how to get started via our Cloud-based Bluemix tools, and how these offerings can solve real business problems. All of these key capabilities are illustrated via a real life Internet of Things application which was developed especially for this event. The IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics Day is offered as two half day sessions: Essentials overview and demo is targeted at business types and executives, and the Hands-on Workshop is the key component for IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics Day designed with developers as the target audience. These events are tailored for developers and business leaders to understand the value and essentials of the IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics portfolio. Through demonstrations and hands-on labs you will see the Architecture of the Solution, Open Cloud environment with IBM Bluemix, Connected devices, Utilization of Cloudant DBaaS, Hadoop and MapReduce, Building the Analytics layer with SPSS and R. 1.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.
