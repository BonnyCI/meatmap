"22","1374082956000","<p>Join us on Tuesday, July 30th at 5:30pm in Foster City!</p> <p>Rapidly gaining in popularity, maturity and footprint is the HBase NoSQL datastore.  Apache HBase is known as the Hadoop Database and is included in IBM's InfoSphere BigInsights product.  HBase is typically deployed on clusters of Linux x86 servers running on top of Apache Hadoop's HDFS.  HBase clusters scale seamlessly as new nodes are added to the system.  Cost is dramatically reduced,and the big data challenges often found in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMs) are solved with HBase (e.g. sharding is automatic and sparse data records supported).  Whereas existing RDBMSs can manage terabytes of data and support thousands of queries per second, HBase can easily support petabytes of data and millions of queries per second!</p> <p><br/>If you're considering HBase for your data storage needs, learning about the HBase data model and architecture is critical.  This Meetup will give you hands-on HBase experience.  You will go through the basics of how to install HBase, create schemas and tables, query your data, backup your tables, manage, monitor and tune HBase.  You’ll also learn about the various client options including Big SQL and Hive.</p> <p>This Meetup is FREE.  Food and beverages will be provided. Please bring your laptop to participate in the hands-on lab.   Download BigInsights Quick Start Edition <b>before</b> the event: <a href=""http://ibm.co/QuickStart"" class=""linkified"">http://ibm.co/QuickStart</a></p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>5:30-6:30: Networking (Food &amp; Beverages provided)</p> <p>6:30-7:15: Presentation</p> <p>7:15-9:30: Hands-on with HBase</p> <p>Download the VM: <a href=""http://ibm.co/QuickStart"" class=""linkified"">http://ibm.co/QuickStart</a></p> <p>Download the HBase Sample Data: <a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/courses/course/view.php?id=513""><a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/courses/course/view.php?id=513"" class=""linkified"">http://bigdatauniversity.com/courses/course/view.php?id=513</a></a></p> <p>Enrollment Key: meet123up</p> ","14400000","1338938692000","4013112","open","37.18000030517578","-121.75","Big Data Developers","BigDataDevelopers","Members","","130040062","https://www.meetup.com/BigDataDevelopers/events/130040062/","","Big Data Meetup: Hands-on with HBase","","","","past","1375230600000","1375508149000","-25200000","1001 E.

"14","1384550359000","<p>Join us on Thursday, December 5th at 6:00pm to learn how we can gain new insights by analyzing machine logs using Machine Data Analytics. </p> <p>Half of Fortune 500 companies experience more than 80 hours of system down time annually. Spread evenly over a year, that amounts to approximately 13 minutes every day. As a consumer, the thought of online bank operations being inaccessible so frequently is disturbing. As a business owner, when systems go down, all processes come to a stop. Work in progress is destroyed and failure to meet SLA’s and contractual obligations can result in expensive fees, adverse publicity, and loss of current and potential future customers. Ultimately the inability to provide a reliable and stable system results in loss of $$$’s. While the failure of these systems is inevitable, the ability to timely predict failures and intercept them before they occur is now a requirement.</p> <p>A possible solution to the problem can be found is in the huge volumes of diagnostic big data generated at hardware, firmware, middleware, application, storage and management layers indicating failures or errors. Machine analysis and understanding of this data is becoming an important part of debugging, performance analysis, root cause analysis and business analysis. In addition to preventing outages, machine data analysis can also provide insights for fraud detection, customer retention and other important use cases. </p> <p>This Meetup is FREE.  Food and Beverages will also be provided. </p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:00pm-7pm: Registration / Food and Beverages </p> <p>7:00pm: Topic Presentation</p> <p>7:45-8pm: Break</p> <p>8pm: Live Demo</p> <p>8:30pm: Networking</p> ","10800000","1338938692000","4013112","open","37.18000030517578","-121.75","Big Data Developers","BigDataDevelopers","Members","","151114922","https://www.meetup.com/BigDataDevelopers/events/151114922/","","Gain New Insights by Analyzing Machine Logs using Machine Data Analytics","","","","past","1386295200000","1394830738000","-28800000","1001 E.

In a few years, the automotive industry will be the largest data producer of data after utilities -- bigger than health care. And with this Big Data volume comes Big Data challenges. The opportunity for applying all this data in real-time to problems in transportation, congestion management, emergency response, microweather prediction, supply chain management, and so on is tremendous. But this requires a real-time analytics platform that can integrate GPS locations, telematics messages and sensor readings, video, and other kinds of information--and scale up to any level. Beyond automotive applications, the need for a real-time big-data analytics platform is becoming critical in other industries, including Government, Telecommunications, Healthcare, Energy and Utilities, Finance, and Manufacturing.</p> <p>Bring your laptop, because you'll have an opportunity to get hands-on with InfoSphere Streams and apply this exciting new technology yourself!

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.

The big data community has been making great strides in recent years to secure Hadoop clusters where all aspects of security are now covered—authentication, authorization, encryption of data-in-transit, encryption of data-at-rest, and centralized auditing. At the same time, many challenges are still facing cluster administrators who are responsible for setting up security, and developers who are charged with integrating new services into existing secure clusters.  In this talk, we’ll cover basic concepts that form the foundation of big data security such as Kerberos/SPNEGO, impersonation, TLS and encryption key management. We’ll discuss challenges we’ve had in deploying the Hadoop clusters in real-world scenarios and lessons learned when integrating new components/services into secure clusters.</p> <p><br/><i><b>Presenter: Richard Ding, IBM</b></i><br/>Richard Ding is big data architect for IBM, who is responsible for the security aspects of IBM Open Platform and IBM BigInsights, IBM’s 100% open source Hadoop distribution. Over the past years, he has been working with customers to setup secure Spark/Hadoop clusters and helping developers to integrate new services into secure clusters.</p> <p><b>Part </b><b>II</b><b>: </b><b>Disaster </b><b>Recovery</b><b> on Hadoop</b></p> <p>As organizations’ maturity levels around big data technologies increase, we’re seeing a rise in the use of Apache Hadoop as a component of business-critical systems which raises new risks from an IT management perspective. They need the same kind of protection as any other tier-one system, in terms of high availability and disaster recovery capabilities. In this meetup we will focus on different replication strategies that can be leveraged based on RTO and RPO requirements and their pro's and cons.</p> <p><br/><i><b>Presenter:  Vinayak Agrawal, IBM</b></i><br/>Vinayak (Vin) Agrawal is the Product Manager for Big Replicate at IBM. He started his career with IBM after earning his masters from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. He has worked in multiple technical roles for BigInsights product. He has been working on the Hadoop platform and other open source technologies for 5 years and has deep understanding of these technologies. He has implemented Hadoop projects in various industries for multiple mission critical use cases. </p> ","9000000","1338938692000","4013112","open","37.18000030517578","-121.75","Big Data Developers","BigDataDevelopers","Members","Room: 20-20113.
