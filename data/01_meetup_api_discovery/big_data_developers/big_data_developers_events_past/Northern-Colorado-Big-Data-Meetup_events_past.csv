"11","1418326257000","<p>Folks,</p> <p>I'd like to start this meetup with a ""Local Projects Night"" to get to know each other, find out what specific interests the group has, and what work is being done in Northern Colorado. It would be great to have 5 - 10 of our members to talk for 5 - 10 minutes about what projects they're working on such as new technology, or interesting uses for existing technology.</p> <p>Please let me know if you or someone from your company would be interested in giving one of these ""lightning talks"". Let me know the gist of what you'd like to share with the group and I'll start putting together an agenda. If there are more people than we can handle in one night I'll just make a judgment call about what I think the group would benefit most from, and perhaps we'll do it again some time. Feel free to say so if your company is hiring, but let's keep talks focused on the topic.</p> <p>I expect we'll do this on a Thursday evening in mid- to late-January. I believe we have an ideal location in Fort Collins, and I'll post details as soon as it's confirmed.</p> ","","1418101283000","18241821","open","40.47999954223633","-104.9000015258789","Northern Colorado Big Data Meetup","Northern-Colorado-Big-Data-Meetup","Members","","219195497","https://www.meetup.com/Northern-Colorado-Big-Data-Meetup/events/219195497/","","Local Projects Night","","","","past","1421371800000","1421384052000","-25200000","3404 E Harmony Rd","","Fort Collins","us","23561890","40.52353286743164","USA","-105.01502227783203","HP, building 6 lower","","False","CO","","public","0","12"
"4","1423074691000","<p>Mark Nelson, who you may have heard speak on graph analytics with Spark  at the Boulder/Denver BigData Meetup last year, will be speaking:</p> <p>


<i>At Trueffect we use Spark (along with Hadoop) for analysis of our ad server logs. We take advantage of Spark’s ability to cache data in memory to run iterative algorithms in hours that would take days to run on Hadoop. We are re-implementing many of our current Hadoop-based analytics to use Spark Streaming with the goal of reducing processing delays from hours down to minutes.</i></p> <p>Pizza will be provided courtesy of Cloudera! I'd like to make sure we have plenty of time to hear from Mark, so let's plan on starting the talk around 6:45 and doing more chatting / networking after Mark's presentation &amp; questions.</p> ","5400000","1418101283000","18241821","open","40.47999954223633","-104.9000015258789","Northern Colorado Big Data Meetup","Northern-Colorado-Big-Data-Meetup","Members","","220303710","https://www.meetup.com/Northern-Colorado-Big-Data-Meetup/events/220303710/","","Stream Analytics at Trueffect","","50","","past","1424395800000","1424449097000","-25200000","201 Peterson Street","","Fort Collins","us","23551234","40.58546447753906","USA","-105.07199096679688","Community Room at the Old Town Library ","","False","CO","","public","0","16"
"3","1431444984000","<p>The digital marketing industry, specifically display advertising, has provided many opportunities for analytical optimization and predictive modeling. In this discussion, Mike will share some of the ""Big Data"" techniques that solve problems like:</p> <p>• Who is most likely to download a new iPhone app, such as 'DoodleJump'? (technique: Naive Bayes)</p> <p>• How likely is it that a given consumer will purchase from a retailer (e.g. REI) in the next 30 days?

"9","1439914753000","<p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Implementing solutions with Apache Hadoop requires understanding not just Hadoop, but a broad range of related projects in the Hadoop ecosystem such as Hive, Pig, Oozie, Sqoop, and Flume. The good news is that there’s an abundance of materials – books, web sites, conferences, etc. – for gaining a deep understanding of Hadoop and these related projects. The bad news is there’s still a scarcity of information on how to integrate these components to implement complete solutions. In this tutorial we’ll walk through an end-to-end case study of a clickstream analytics engine to provide a concrete example of how to architect and implement a complete solution with Hadoop. We’ll use this example to illustrate important topics such as:</p> <p>• Modeling data in Hadoop and selecting optimal storage formats for data stored in Hadoop</p> <p>• Moving data between Hadoop and external data management systems such as relational databases</p> <p>• Moving event-based data such as logs and machine generated data into Hadoop</p> <p>• Accessing and processing data in Hadoop</p> <p>• Orchestrating and scheduling workflows on Hadoop</p> <p>Throughout the example, best practices and considerations for architecting applications on Hadoop will be covered. This talk will be valuable for developers, architects, or project leads who are already knowledgeable about Hadoop, and are now looking for more insight into how it can be leveraged to implement real-world applications.</p> <p><b>Biography:</b></p> <p>Mark Grover is a co-author of O'Reilly Hadoop Application Architectures. He is also a committer on Apache Bigtop, a committer and PMC member on Apache Sentry (incubating) and a contributor to</p> <p>Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache Sqoop, Apache Pig and Apache Flume. He is a section author of O’Reilly’s book on Apache Hive – Programming Hive. He speaks and blogs frequently on the big data ecosystem and works as a Software Engineer at Cloudera.</p> ","","1418101283000","18241821","open","40.47999954223633","-104.9000015258789","Northern Colorado Big Data Meetup","Northern-Colorado-Big-Data-Meetup","Members","http://www.training.colostate.edu/maps/map-bohemian.pdf","224717963","https://www.meetup.com/Northern-Colorado-Big-Data-Meetup/events/224717963/","","Architecting Applications with Apache Hadoop","","85","","past","1444348800000","1444385397000","-21600000","501 W Laurel St","","Ft.
