In Spark, the querying is done in-memory where real-time or archived data can provide faster time-to-value results. Spark was designed to provide from 10 to 100 times faster performance for specific applications. It complements Hadoop’s capabilities by providing a unified platform for storing and analyzing the data in a single environment.</p> <p><br/>It offers an integral view and opportunity to gain valuable insights by analyzing large volumes of structured and unstructured data. The main benefit is the capability to deliver these real-time insights based on a simplified software development process - creating and running algorithms to extract value from a wide range of data sets. Apache Spark is the platform for creating and running such algorithms.</p> <p><br/>This session is a technical discussion so all big data architects, developers, technical personnel, etc. are welcome to attend.</p> <p><br/>Please join us Wednesday, October 7 2015 for a virtual discussion (details to follow) of Apache Spark to learn more about this newer technology and the advantages gained when data scientists can build models quickly and run iterative jobs on distributed data sets.

"2","1462985528000","<p>Apache Spark is an open source big data processing framework built around speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. First developed in 2009, Spark provides several advantages over other big data and MapReduce technologies. With Spark, Hadoop clusters can run up to 100 times faster in memory, and 10 times faster when running on disk. With the ability to write applications in Java, Scala or even Python, Spark is a flexible and power paradigm.</p> <p>With IBM's ""Open for Data"" cloud computing initiative, current and prospective users can provision an instance of Spark in the cloud in a matter of minutes without up-front infrastructure investment. The power of the cloud empowers users to scale up massively based on business needs. De-provisioning resources when those needs change is equally as agile, giving our users the best value for performance.<br/>Please join us on Tuesday June 14th, 2016 at 12:00 noon as we discuss Spark both deployed as a service and on premise.
