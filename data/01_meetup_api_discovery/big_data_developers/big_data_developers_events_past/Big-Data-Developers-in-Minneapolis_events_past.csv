Apache™ Hadoop® is an open source software project that enables distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of commodity servers. It is designed to scale up from a single server to thousands of machines, with very high degree of fault tolerance. Rather than relying on high-end hardware, the resiliency of these clusters comes from the software's ability to detect and handle failures at the application layer.</p> <p><br/>Please bring your own laptop for this workshop.  An IBM Softlayer cloud environment will be provided to get you started.  Questions about the cloud environment can be directed to Amber Murphy at amber.m@evolvingsol.com.</p> <p><br/>The workshop will begin at 12:00 pm with registration and lunch and will conclude at 5:00 pm.  Join Evolving Solutions following the meeting for networking with appetizers and beverages in the Marriott lobby lounge.</p> <p><br/>Evolving Solutions is a leading IT infrastructure, software and cloud services provider in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area and has spent 20 years building relationships with many medium and large enterprises in North America.  Evolving Solutions has become a strategic partner that clients are able to depend upon for assistance in key solutions throughout the technology lifecycle.  From assessing and planning to implementation and maintenance, they have professional skills, consultants and engineers to be trusted technology advisors.  <a href=""http://www.evolvingsol.com"">www.evolvingsol.com</a></p> <p>

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.

This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine?

"1","1458942339000","<p>Join Evolving Solutions and IBM for a Big Data &amp; Apache Spark Developer Day on April 28th at the Minneapolis Marriott Southwest.  This is a customer event only.</p> <p><br/>The Developer Day will introduce the open source processing engine, Apache Spark, highlighting not only it's awesome power but how it fits within the larger data landscape. You will learn why Spark was developed to crunch through Big Data, what MapReduce is, and why Spark can beat the pants off of it in terms of performance and ease of use. You will learn how non-programmers can get started with Spark (warning: there is no escaping code, but you can do it, we promise), with a hands on lab exploring Spark and the Spark Machine Learning library. </p> <p>Specifically, the lab will introduce the data science methodology cycle through the implementation of one specific analytic approach: text classification.  Through concrete examples, you will use Apache Spark and its machine learning library to develop and train a Naeve Bayes classifier.  During this lab, we will also use a Jupyter Notebook to interact with a Spark cluster and explore text data as well as access data from files, object storage and through SQL to learn when each method is useful.   </p> <p><i><b>Agenda:</b></i></p> <p>12:00 to 01:00 pm - Registration and Lunch<br/>01:00 to 02:00 pm - Overview of Apache Spark<br/>02:00 to 05:00 pm - Hands-on Lab - Spark Machine Learning/Text Classifier</p> <p>To confirm your seat, please register here:  <b><a href=""http://ibm.co/1MGVQ6b""><a href=""http://ibm.co/1MGVQ6b"" class=""linkified"">http://ibm.co/1MGVQ6b</a></a></b></p> <p><br/>Lunch will be provided.  Join Evolving Solutions and IBM for some networking and refreshments after the hands-on lab.</p> ","18000000","1363601061000","7667362","open","44.97999954223633","-93.2699966430664","Big Data Developers in Minneapolis","Big-Data-Developers-in-Minneapolis","Developers","zip 55343","229874912","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Minneapolis/events/229874912/","","Big Data & Apache Spark Developer Day","","","","past","1461862800000","1461887003000","-18000000","5801 Opus Pkwy","","Minnetonka","us","14912712","44.89772415161133","USA","-93.40635681152344","Minneapolis Marriott Southwest ","","False","MN","55343","public","0","40"
