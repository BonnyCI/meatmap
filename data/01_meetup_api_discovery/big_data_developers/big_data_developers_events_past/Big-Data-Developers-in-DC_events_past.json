You can issue JDBC queries or ODBC\u00a0queries to access data that is stored in InfoSphere BigInsights, in the same way that you access databases from your enterprise applications.</p> <p><br/>You can use Big SQL to issue queries of any size, including concurrent queries. Big SQL provides support for large ad-hoc queries by using MapReduce parallelism and point queries, which are low-latency queries that return information quickly to\u00a0reduce response time and provide improved access to data. \u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\nHBase is a column-oriented database management system that runs on top of HDFS. It is well suited for sparse data sets,\u00a0which are common in many big data use cases. Unlike relational database systems, HBase does not support a structured\u00a0query language like SQL; in fact, HBase isn\u2019t a relational data store at all.\u00a0 HBase applications are typically written in Java much like\u00a0a MapReduce application or in other languages by using Apache Thrift.\u00a0 However, HBase can be queried with SQL when\u00a0combined with Hive and or Big SQL!</p> <p>\n\n\nApache Accumulo, like HBase, derives from Google's BigTable technology.\u00a0 While the two technologies are similar in architecture, Accumulo excels in security right down to the cell level.\u00a0 Attendees will receive an introduction to Apache Accumulo and hear about IBM's Accumulo research project.</p> <p>\n\n<b>Join us from 11:00am - 6:00pm on February the 4th to learn about Big SQL, Hive and HBase.
