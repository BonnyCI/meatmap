You will learn how to access data from an external source using the Source type operators and write an output stream using the Sink type operators. You will then learn how and when to use the various Stream operators, like the Functor, Punctor, Aggregation, Sort, Join, Split, Barrier, Delay, and Switch operators. Lab exercise demonstrations will use the InfoSphere Streams IDE that is based upon Eclipse as the development and testing environment, but you will get the opportunity to see the invocation of the compilation of a Streams program from the command line as well.</p> <p>\n\n\n---------------<br/>This Meetup takes place at an IBM Location, in order to get an entrance badge please register in addition to RSVP at least one day in advance using this link <a href=\"http://ibm.co/WxWZsJ\" class=\"linkified\">http://ibm.co/WxWZsJ</a><br/>---------------</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1410168871000, "id": "205903342", "name": "NoSQL & DB Management in the Cloud w/ Livestream of Keynote @Cassandra Summit SF", "status": "past", "time": 1410447600000, "updated": 1410459327000, "utc_offset": 7200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 7, "venue": {"id": 15964522, "name": "IBM Innovation Center Zurich,8010 Zurich", "lat": 47.39302062988281, "lon": 8.485883712768555, "repinned": false, "address_1": "Vulkanstrasse 106", "city": "Z\u00fcrich", "country": "ch", "localized_country_name": "Switzerland"}, "group": {"created": 1378937069000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Switzerland", "id": 10220112, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 47.380001068115234, "lon": 8.539999961853027, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/205903342/", "description": "<p>---------------<br/>This Meetup takes place at an IBM Location, in order to get an entrance badge please register in addition to RSVP at least one day in advance using this link <a href=\"http://ibm.co/1s0JGxI\" class=\"linkified\">http://ibm.co/1s0JGxI</a><br/>---------------</p> <p><br/>Summary: Learn how a simple application using Apache CouchDB can be implemented and made accessible on a mobile device within 30 minutes, then follow the Live-Stream and after that join our networking session</p> <p>Highlights:<br/>- Learn how to use NoSQL Databases in the Cloud on our new PaaS Cloud Environment www.bluemix.net<br/>- Listen to the Keynote from Cassandra Summit in San Fransisco<br/>- Network with the Colleagues from the BigData and Cloud Ecosystem</p> <p>Description:</p> <p>Cloudant is our DBaaS offering based on Apache CouchDB which is free of charge for the 1st 2 GB and then costs $1 per GB/month.

The buzzword behind this is DOCKER. Although present for many years in cgroups, namespaces and LXC - container based virtualzation really took off as Docker Inc. brought this technology to the masses. Today, every 2nd IT startup is running on DOCKER. Enterprises and Academic institutions are slowly adapting as well. In this session we will learn what DOCKER really is, what Linux Kernel extensions are used and how you can use it in your environment. We will create a DOCKER image from scratch, add persistent storage to it and showcase a little cluster computing task using ApacheFlink and DOCKER-Compose. Finally I'll give you a short introduction to DOCKER on the cloud - currently offered by nearly every cloud service provider - and exemplified in the IBM Bluemix Platform Cloud.</p> <p>Note: If available please bring your own laptop to the seminar.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 5}, {"created": 1453732183000, "id": "228345778", "name": "Strategy & Tech Talk - From meters to pacemakers - the Internet of Things", "status": "past", "time": 1455210000000, "rsvp_close_offset": "PT78H", "updated": 1455224440000, "utc_offset": 3600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 38, "venue": {"id": 24108254, "name": "IBM Cloud Transformation Lab", "lat": 47.39302062988281, "lon": 8.485883712768555, "repinned": false, "address_1": "Vulkanstrasse 106", "city": "Z\u00fcrich", "country": "ch", "localized_country_name": "Switzerland"}, "group": {"created": 1378937069000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Switzerland", "id": 10220112, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 47.380001068115234, "lon": 8.539999961853027, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/228345778/", "description": "<p><b>--------------- </b></p> <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b></p> <p><b>Please register at <a href=\"http://sttalks.mybluemix.net\">sttalks.mybluemix.net</a> for your badge until 8 February 2016, 23:59 - thank you!</b></p> <p><b>--------------- </b></p> <p><b><br/></b> <b> Trifork, Basho and IBM Softlayer invite you to this\u00a0Strategy&amp;Tech Talk: \u00a0From Meters to Pacemakers - the Plumbing to turn IoT hype into reality.\u00a0</b></p> <p><br/>This Evening we will present you with three sessions all dealing with how you can get the most out of IoT and your Big Data:\u00a0</p> <p>The session with Basho Technologies:<br/>The Managing Director of Basho EMEA - Manu Marchal will give you his insight into the prospects and the opportunities and how Riak TS can solve your Big Data problems.</p> <p>The world is currently creating over 2.5 quintillion bits of data every day. \u00a0This data, generated by mobile devices, apps, sensors and wearable tech represents highly valuable information. \u00a0Making accurate, real-time decisions with raw data to unlock its economic potential is now becoming crucial for countless businesses.

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that\u00b4s why \"In Silico Medicine\" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live\" class=\"embedded\">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1472501091000, "duration": 14400000, "id": "233719099", "name": "DataFirst Launch Event \u2013 Experience new ways to put your data to work", "status": "past", "time": 1474992000000, "updated": 1475009051000, "utc_offset": 7200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 8, "venue": {"id": 24745891, "name": "Hudson Mercantile Bldg", "lat": 40.755863189697266, "lon": -73.99864959716797, "repinned": false, "address_1": "500 West 36th Street", "city": "New York", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "NY"}, "group": {"created": 1378937069000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Switzerland", "id": 10220112, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 47.380001068115234, "lon": 8.539999961853027, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/233719099/", "description": "<p>On September 27, 2016, leading minds in data and analytics will come together and unveil the latest in cloud technology, enabling you to more efficiently put data to work.

However, despite its age, NZZ is far from being old-fashioned. Especially when it comes to data-driven decision making and data-driven innovation, NZZ has been investing a lot within the last three years. For wrangling large amounts of data we have been using Apache Spark for almost a year now \u2013 and do not regret this choice. It had not only given us flexibility with ad-hoc analytics, but also drives our data-products (in production). In this talk I will share some of our use cases as well as insights we gained over the last year with Apache Spark. I will especially talk about how we calculate article recommendations and showcase some new exciting data products which are currently in active development.\u00a0</p> <p>Bio:\u00a0<br/>Ren\u00e9 Pfitzner is the Lead Data Scientist at NZZ, Switzerland\u2019s newspaper of records.
