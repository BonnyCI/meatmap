He has held senior sales engineering and management positions at Rational Software, PureAtria,\u00a0IBM, Appistry and Palamida. Throughout his career, he has enabled organizations to accelerate technology adoption by understanding their needs and providing just-in-time business solutions. As WANdisco Director of Product Management for Big Data, Brett works with partners, prospects, and customers to help them understand and evolve the requirements for enterprise-ready Hadoop.</p> <p><br/>----------------</p> <p>Big Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion\u2014immediate response and action.\u00a0</p> <p>The collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:\u00a0</p> <p>- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics\u00a0applications without downtime or data loss\u00a0<br/>- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing\u00a0<br/>- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.\u00a0</p> <p>This meet up will provide an overview of the \u201cbest in class\u201d architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with \u201cContinuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark\u201d\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Big SQL 4.1.</b>\u00a0Presenters:\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0Michael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM</p> <p>\u00a0Big SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.\u00a0</p> <p>With Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources.\u00a0</p> <p><b>PARKING</b></p> <p>Street parking in certain areas (across the street &amp; up to 2 blocks away) at 5pm is free.\u00a0 Check the signs so as not to get booted!\u00a0</p> <p>Garage parking is on Columbus Drive in the same building as HopsScotch.\u00a0 They validate parking for $2.00 up to 4 hours.\u00a0</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 9}, {"created": 1462218784000, "id": "230821853", "name": "Apache Spark Maker Community Event", "status": "past", "time": 1465263000000, "updated": 1465275359000, "utc_offset": -14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "venue": {"id": 24523428, "name": "Galvanize U", "lat": 37.787601470947266, "lon": -122.39664459228516, "repinned": false, "address_1": "44 Tehama Street", "city": "San Francisco", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "CA"}, "group": {"created": 1446859015000, "name": "Open Source Analytics - New Jersey", "id": 19097690, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 40.72999954223633, "lon": -74.05000305175781, "urlname": "Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey/events/230821853/", "description": "<p>On June 6, 2016, leading minds in data and analytics from Tesla, Netflix, Silicon Valley Data Science, and IBM will come together to demonstrate how open data and analytics technologies such as R, Spark, Python and more are forming a vibrant ecosystem.

Structured Streaming allows you to express your streaming computation the same way you would express a computation on static data. This has two benefits. The first is code reuse as essentially the same queries be run on batch, interactive or streaming data. Second, it simplifies streaming application development as you can operate on streams of data just like you can on static data using DataFrames. Structured Streaming abstracts away the complexity of streaming analytics allowing you to perform streaming analytics without having to reason about streaming. The Spark SQL engine takes care of running Structured Streaming queries and incrementally and continuously updating the result as streaming data continues to arrive. With Spark Structured Streaming, you can express streaming aggregations, event-time windows, as well as join streaming data to static data. In this session, we\u2019ll walk through the basics of Structured Streaming, its programming model and APIs. The concepts will be illustrated using code examples. Then, we\u2019ll walk through a demo of analyzing both static and streaming sensor data to show how the same queries can be used on each, thereby simplifying streaming analytics application development, and how static and streaming data can be leveraged together.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 3}, {"created": 1488567256000, "duration": 3600000, "id": "238147517", "name": "Generalized Streaming Pipelines with Spark Streaming, Kafka", "status": "past", "time": 1488906000000, "updated": 1488911419000, "utc_offset": -18000000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 15, "group": {"created": 1446859015000, "name": "Open Source Analytics - New Jersey", "id": 19097690, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 40.72999954223633, "lon": -74.05000305175781, "urlname": "Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey", "who": "Members"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-Analytics-New-Jersey/events/238147517/", "description": "<p>This is a live webinar.
