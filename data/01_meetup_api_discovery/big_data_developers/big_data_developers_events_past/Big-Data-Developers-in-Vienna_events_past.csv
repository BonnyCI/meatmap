Note: This is a WebCast only since we want that everybody benefits from the opportunity that Chris is in Europe.</p> <p>

Christopher Bienko is WW expert on Data Management in the Cloud and everybody will have the chance to ask questions in this session.</p> <p><br/>Technical deep-dives will follow this session.</p> <p>

Cloudant is based on Apache CouchDB but enhanced in serveral ways.</p> <p>

Cloudant is an innovator in data management, providing a NoSQL, JSON database-as-a-service (DBaaS) that enables developers of fast-growing Web and mobile applications to focus on developing their applications without the need to manage database infrastructure or growth. In this one hour introduction to Cloundant, we'll examine how Cloudant accelerates and extends IBM’s Big Data &amp; Analytics portfolio. The agenda includes a review of the NoSQL database landscape, as well as specific features, use cases, and Cloudant customer success stories. Come and equip yourself with an understanding of this disruptive new technology for the world of databases.</p> <p>

DETAILS TO CONNECT TO LIVE-STREAM ARE INDICATED BELOW.  </b></i></p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.</p> <p>On June 15, 2015, IBM will host a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

Abstract:</p> <p><br/>Currently DeepLearning - large neural networks with advanced topologies - are taking over the machine learning ecosystem. In the case of times series they currently are superseding Hidden Markov models and other traditional algorithms. In this talk we will show how Deep Neural Networks can be used for anomaly detection on high dimensional network monitoring data. Do it yourself and read accelerometer data from your mobile device and stream this data to via MQTT to the Watson IoT Platform. Learn how to classify this data into different movement patterns (standing/sitting, walking, running, dancing).</p> ","7200000","1400265324000","14493632","open","48.220001220703125","16.3700008392334","Big Data Developers in Vienna","Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna","Big Data Enthusiasts","","232609255","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna/events/232609255/","","BerlinTOA LiveStream: DeepLearning and Advanced Machine Learning on IoT","","","","past","1468591200000","1468599624000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","7"

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that´s why ""In Silico Medicine"" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live"" class=""embedded"">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ","1800000","1400265324000","14493632","open","48.220001220703125","16.3700008392334","Big Data Developers in Vienna","Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna","Big Data Enthusiasts","","234293154","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Vienna/events/234293154/","","Webcast MipTec Basel: Massive parallel GPU accelerated DeepLearning in the cloud","","","","past","1474555500000","1474559248000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","2"
