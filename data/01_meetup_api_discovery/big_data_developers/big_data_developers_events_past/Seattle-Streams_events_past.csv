"0","1490199064000","<p>Greetings Streamers !! </p> <p>Spark is recognized as a great analytics engine. One of its benefits is its inclusion of machine learning algorithms that can group, predict, classify and even recommend based on the analysis of a corpus of data. Once the model is created, it can be applied to new data. In some situations, there is a need to score the model while the data is streaming to decide what to do with the new data.</p> <p>In this latest Data Science Central Webinar event, you will learn how to process the data to arrive at a model and how the resulting model can be used to score streaming data using IBM Streams.</p> <p><br/><b>Register Online Here:  <a href=""http://bit.ly/2o4YZag""><a href=""http://bit.ly/2o4YZag"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2o4YZag</a></a></b></p> ","3600000","1435841329000","18714101","open","47.61000061035156","-122.33000183105469","Seattle Streams","Seattle-Streams","Streamers","Live Webinar is PST.
