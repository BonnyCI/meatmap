Title: Apache Cassandra &amp; Apache Spark for Time Series Data (45 minutes)</p> <p>Presenter: Patrick McFadin</p> <p>Bio: Patrick McFadin is regarded as one of the experts of Apache Cassandra and data modeling techniques. As the Chief Evangelist for Apache Cassandra and consultant for DataStax, he has helped build some of the largest deployments in the world. Previous to DataStax, he was Chief Architect at Hobsons, an education services company. There, he spoke often on Web Application design and performance.</p> <p>Synopsis: Apache Cassandra has proven to be one of the best solutions for storing and retrieving time series data at high velocity and high volume. This talk will discuss how the storage model of Cassandra is ideal for time series use cases and go over examples of how to best build data models. We will also cover pairing Apache Spark with Apache Cassandra to create a real time data analytics platform. Attendees will leave this session knowing how to build their own real time data analytics platform, and will be shocked at how easy it is!</p> <p>

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more. </p> <p>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine?

Discussion 1</p> <p>

Title:  Building a Reactive RESTful API with Akka HTTP and Slick</p> <p>

Abstract:</p> <p><br/>Zalando’s engineering team is currently rebuilding our “shop”—the unit that includes our 15 country-specific, customer-facing websites—to transform it from a monolith into a microservices architecture. As part of this work, we have developed open-source tools in a variety of languages. One of this tools, Innkeeper, is a simple, RESTful route management API built on top of reactive technologies like Akka HTTP and Slick. It will help our fleet of router instances to keep their routes in sync.</p> <p><br/>In this presentation, I'll discuss Innkeeper’s architecture and how — by choosing a reactive stack of technologies — we can stream database records back to the browser. I’ll talk about how (and why) we secured our API using OAuth, and give insights on how we use Docker and the STUPS tools to auto-scale this API on top of AWS. Finally, I’ll describe how we designed a set of unit and integration tests to make sure that our application works correctly, and how we set up our continuous integration environment.</p> <p><br/>About the speaker:  Dan Persa has been a software engineer at Zalando since 2013 and is a member of the Fashion Store team, which is responsible for Zalando’s core ecommerce business. He loves Java and Scala and more recently has been exploring Go and Node.js. He’s a big fan of clean code and software craftsmanship. In addition to coding, he enjoys mentoring new developers, organizing coder dojos and reading groups and giving tech talks. In his free time he likes to take photos and dance salsa.</p> <p>

Discussion 2</p> <p><br/>Title: Cloud Scale Machine Learning with ApacheSpark, MLLIB, Cloudfoundry and OpenStack Swift</p> <p><br/>Speaker: Romeo Kienzler - Chief Data Scientist - IBM Cloud Transformation Lab Zurich</p> <p><br/>Abstract: Clouds provide very cost effective access to computing power and storage. Especially on workloads with high variation on computational and storage resource requirements. Resilient data processing engines like Apache Spark,  a parallel machine learning library on top like MLLIB and elastic storage services like OpenStack Swift are a perfect fit to build a Resilient data processing framework. And this is exactly what IBM has done on the IBM Platform as a Service Cloud called Bluemix. In this session I'll give a very short introduction into all these technologies, open standards and frameworks in order to prepare you for a end - to -end demonstration of a large DNA sequence analysis.</p> <p><br/>About the speaker: Romeo Kienzler holds a Master Degree in Information Systems with specialisation in Applied Statistics and Bioinformatics from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. He works for IBM Zurich as a chief data scientist and architect. His current research focus is on large-scale machine learning on resilient cloud infrastructures based on Apache Spark and Apache Flink on top of Docker Swarm.Romeo Kienzler is a Member of the IBM Academy of Technology, the IBM Technical Expert Council and the IBM BigData BlackBelts team.</p> <p>

Discussion 3</p> <p><br/>Title: The Typesafe Reactive Platform and Apache Spark: Experiences, Challenges and Roadmaps</p> <p><br/>Speaker:  Stavros Kontopoulos, Typesafe</p> <p><br/>Abstract:  In this presentation Stavros Kontopoulos will discuss the role Apache Spark plays for the Typesafe Reactive Platform. He will discuss the Spark team's contribution to the open source project, cover added features like backpressure and dynamic allocation, and describe challenges the team has faced while developing infrastructure for integrated testing. He will also share upcoming roadmap plans, such as:</p> <p><br/>kerberos security, already there for hadoop a must for the enterprise world.</p> <p><br/>Closely examine Tachyon technology.</p> <p><br/>More closely integrate Spark with Typesafe Reactive Platform and our commercial product ConductR</p> <p><br/>About the speaker: Stavros Kontopoulos recently joined the Apache spark team at Typesafe. Prior to Typesafe, Stavros worked in telecoms for several years developing network management products. Immediately before Typesafe he worked as a big-data engineer in the digital marketing sector  for a start-up (Pollfish Inc). Stavros has extensive hands-on experience with web technologies. When not coding he is doing research pursuing a Phd degree with areas of interest being: sublinear algorithms, big data estimators, massive data indexing structures, social network analysis and data structures.</p> ","9000000","1400109744000","14460772","open","52.52000045776367","13.380000114440918","Big Data Developers in Berlin","Big-Data-Developers-in-Berlin","Big Data Enthusiasts","","227744512","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Berlin/events/227744512/","","Apache Spark, Scala, Reactive Technologies and Machine Learning  discussions","","80","","past","1452618000000","1452628541000","3600000","Mollstraße 1","","Berlin","de","24265361","52.526458740234375","Germany","13.415450096130371","Zalando SE","","False","","","public","0","80"

But it also already entered the Life Science domain. Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that´s why ""In Silico Medicine"" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark. First, we will introduce the overall architecture, followed by a live demonstration of the system and we end with a call for action to use and contribute to the framework.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live"" class=""embedded"">http://www.youtube.com/c/RomeoKienzler/live</a></p> ","1800000","1400109744000","14460772","open","52.52000045776367","13.380000114440918","Big Data Developers in Berlin","Big-Data-Developers-in-Berlin","Big Data Enthusiasts","","234293135","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Berlin/events/234293135/","","Webcast MipTec Basel: Massive parallel GPU accelerated DeepLearning in the cloud","","","","past","1474555500000","1474559248000","7200000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public","0","14"
