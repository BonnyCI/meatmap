"19","1377275042000","<p>Streaming data is all around us – from social media feeds to call data records – but can be difficult to leverage. Sometimes there is simply too much data to collect and store before analyzing it. Sometimes it’s an issue of timing – by the time they store data on disk, analyze it, and respond – it’s too late. Organizations need a way to harness the natural resource of streaming data and turn it into actionable insight. Enter stream computing.</p> <p><br/>Stream computing changes where, when and how much of your business data you can analyze. By extracting insight from data as it is streaming, you can react to events as they are happening to reshape business outcomes. Store less, analyze more, and make better decisions, faster. From increased customer retention to earlier fraud detection to more frequent cross-selling, the benefits of stream computing are many. </p> <p>______________________</p> <p>Here is a <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/photos/15184542/"">map </a>&lt;a href=""http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/3/8/global_274034392.jpeg""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;to the meeting location.</p> <p><br/>Enter the building from the ground floor lobby and use the south elevator bank to go to the 5th floor.</p> <p><b>Please note</b> - the doors close at 6:00 pm.

"2","1393973396000","<p>In last month's discussion, we discussed STREAMS and the use of Annotator Query Language (AQL) and other tools to analyze real time data.</p> <p>Come learn how to boost your Text Analytics productivity and capabilities with AQL!! </p> <p>This session we will discuss<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/kf7owtt"">AQL</a>, a query language designed for Text Analytics which provides analysts and programmers a set of SQL-like expressions so it’s immediately familiar, making it easier to learn and develop. The engine was developed by IBM research. IBM has been working in this area for many years and regularly work with customers to extend and enhance its capabilities.</p> <p>Why and What is Text Analytics?</p> <p>Text Analytics is a way to extract information from unstructured and semi-structured documents. By extracting information from these documents, you can combine it with other more traditional structured information to get a more complete view of your business, your customers and your competitors. Most text documents are written by people to convey information to other people so they don't follow strict rules controlling content, layout and style. As a result, you can't use traditional ETL tools to extract information from them. Call center records are a good example. They often include fields containing the text of a dialog with a customer and notes and comments made by the call center rep. There's lots of valuable information in these fields, but you can't extract it using ETL tools. The same is true for social media and sentiment data. These new data sources contain huge amounts of very valuable information about your business, your customers and your competitors, but if you want to extract meaningful information from data from blogs, tweets, call center records and other unstructured documents you need Text Analytics.</p> <p>Using Text Analytics we can make it easier to intelligently search and access information from these documents and we can open up the information to traditional Business Intelligence and warehousing tools and technologies. Machines are very good at quickly applying unambiguous rules that can be precisely encoded; but processing documents using rule based or grammar based extraction techniques doesn’t work very well; there's just too much variability and these systems usually become ‘brittle’. IBM Text Analytics is based on a system that lets you identify elements of interest and their context without writing complex and fragile grammars and rules. Think of the way you scan a document, identifying information of interest, determining the context and then extracting the information you need. IBM Text Analytics uses a similar machine based model.</p> ","","1366111606000","8089392","open","33.5099983215332","-112.06999969482422","Big Data Developers in Phoenix","Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix","Developers and Architects","","169436992","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/events/169436992/","","AQL - Annotator Query Language","","","","past","1395279000000","1395290021000","-25200000","8070 E Morgan Trail, Suite 130","","Phoenix","us","17847932","33.57707977294922","USA","-111.90768432617188","QCM Technologies Center for Innovation ","","False","AZ","","public","0","27"

From such diverse sources as social media feeds, Call Detail Records (CDRs), consumer transactions, financial markets, machine sensors, etc., streaming data is present in virtually every modern business process and social interaction. However, the sheer speed and volume of this data type makes it difficult to leverage using conventional systems.</p> <p>Typically, there is too much data to collect, store, and analyze in a timely fashion. By the time data is stored on disk and analyzed, the response is no longer relevant. Organizations need a system that captures the value of streaming data in near-real-time and transforms it into actionable insight. – Enter IBM InfoSphere® Streams.</p> <p>Streams processing is a new computing model that affects the “when,” “where,” and “how” of enterprise data analysis. By processing data as soon as it is captured, the enterprise can react rapidly to events as they occur, resulting in optimized business outcomes. From increased customer retention; to earlier fraud detection; to more productive cross-selling, the benefits of streams processing are many. IBM InfoSphere Streams uses innovative technology to perform rapid real-time analysis of information originating from a myriad of disparate sources resulting in positive outcomes for the enterprise. This Meet-Up session introduces participants to the capabilities of the IBM InfoSphere® Streams platform. The objective of this session is to demonstrate, via simple use cases, the features of the InfoSphere Streams platform.

For interactive queries that require a few seconds (or even milliseconds) of response time, MapReduce (MR) is the wrong choice. On the other hand, for queries that require massive scale and runtime fault tolerance, an MR framework works well. MR was built for large-scale processing on big data, viewed mostly as “batch” processing.</p> <p><br/>As enterprises start using Apache Hadoop as a central data repository for all data — originating from sources as varied as operational systems, sensors, smart devices, metadata and internal applications — SQL processing becomes an optimal choice. A fundamental reason is that most enterprise data management and analytical tools rely on SQL.</p> <p><br/>As a tool for interactive query execution, SQL processing (of relational data) benefits from decades of research, usage experience and optimizations. Clearly, the SQL skills pool far exceeds that of MR developers and data scientists.

"1","1432924311000","<p>Come see the Phoenix-Local LiveStream of a major IBM | SPARK announcement from San Francisco!</p> <p>Apache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative. Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.</p> <p><br/>Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.</p> <p><br/>Do you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does.  Emphatically.  That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value. </p> <p><br/>On June 15, 2015, IBM is hosting a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: <b>IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design</b>.
