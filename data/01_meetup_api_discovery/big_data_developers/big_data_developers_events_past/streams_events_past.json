We'll provide food, drinks, and record for viewing later if you register for the event we'll email you think link after.</p> <p>Abstract<br/>Storm has long served as the main platform for real-time analytics at Twitter. However, as the scale of data being processed in real- time at Twitter has increased, along with an increase in the diversity and the number of use cases, many limitations of Storm have become apparent. We need a system that scales better, has better debug-ability, has better performance, and is easier to manage \u2013 all while working in a shared cluster infrastructure. We considered various alternatives to meet these needs, and in the end concluded that we needed to build a new real-time stream data processing system. This talk will present the design and implementation of the new system, called Heron. Heron is now the de facto stream data processing engine inside Twitter, and we share our experiences from running Heron in production.</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Karthik is the engineering manager and technical lead for Real Time Analytics at Twitter. He has two decades of experience working in parallel databases, big data infrastructure and networking. He cofounded Locomatix, a company that specializes in real time streaming processing on Hadoop and Cassandra using SQL that was acquired by Twitter. Before Locomatix, he had a brief stint with Greenplum where he worked on parallel query scheduling. Greenplum was eventually acquired by EMC for more than $300M. Prior to Greenplum, Karthik was at Juniper Networks where he designed and delivered platforms, protocols, databases and high availability solutions for network routers that are widely deployed in the Internet. Before joining Juniper at University of Wisconsin, he worked extensively in parallel database systems, query processing, scale out technologies, storage engine and online analytical systems. Several of these research were spun as a company later acquired by Teradata.</p> <p>He is the author of several publications, patents and one of the best selling book \"Network Routing: Algorithms, Protocols and Architectures.\" He has a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UW Madison with a focus on databases.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 16}, {"created": 1440812500000, "duration": 9000000, "id": "224961170", "name": "Reactive Streams", "status": "past", "time": 1443142800000, "updated": 1443197179000, "utc_offset": -25200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 71, "venue": {"id": 24063991, "name": "Typesafe, Inc.", "lat": 37.78864669799805, "lon": -122.40167236328125, "repinned": false, "address_1": "625 Market Street, 10th Floor", "city": "San Francisco", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "CA"}, "group": {"created": 1435158878000, "name": "Bay Area Streams", "id": 18695854, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 37.779998779296875, "lon": -122.41999816894531, "urlname": "streams", "who": "Streamers"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/streams/events/224961170/", "description": "<p>Join us on <b>Thursday, September 24th</b>, for an exciting talk with <i><b>Dean Wampler, Ph.D.</b></i>, Architect for Big Data Products &amp; Services, at Typesafe.\u00a0 After more than a year on the drawing board, Reactive Streams has released V1.0 of their API for several different platforms, including Java.\u00a0 This work was done in collaboration with engineers from Typesafe, Netflix, Red Hat, Twitter, Pivotal, Oracle, and others to define a standard for passing streams of data in an asynchronous and non-blocking fashion while ensuring that a fast producer does not overwhelm a slow consumer.\u00a0 This is a common need for Reactive systems when handling large or live data sets while controlling resource consumption. \u00a0</p> <p>Dean will take us through the mechanisms employed by <b>Reactive Streams</b>, discuss the applicability to a variety of problems encountered in day-to-day work on JVM, and give an overview of the ecosystem that is emerging around this young standard, including the updated Spark Streaming scheduled for release in Spark 1.5.</p> <p>Dr. Wampler specializes in scalable, distributed, \"Big Data\" application devellopment using Spark, Mesos, Hadoop, Scala and other tools.\u00a0 He is a co-organizer and frequent speaker at conferences worldwide, the co-organizer of several Chicago-area Meetup Groups, and a contributor to several open source projects.\u00a0 He is the author of \"Programming Scala, 2nd Edition\" and \"Functional Programming for Java Developers\", as well as the co-author of \"Programming Hive\".\u00a0 All of these are from O'Reilly.\u00a0 Dean can be found on <b><i>twitter @deanwampler</i></b>. \u00a0</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 8}, {"created": 1443724087000, "duration": 201600000, "id": "225757803", "name": "ROCK YOUR DATA at Datapalooza...Build a data product in 3 days!", "status": "past", "time": 1447171200000, "rsvp_close_offset": "PT192H", "updated": 1447373655000, "utc_offset": -28800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 8, "venue": {"id": 24126294, "name": "Galvanize U", "lat": 37.78749465942383, "lon": -122.39653015136719, "repinned": false, "address_1": "44 Tehama Street", "city": "San Francisco", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "CA"}, "group": {"created": 1435158878000, "name": "Bay Area Streams", "id": 18695854, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 37.779998779296875, "lon": -122.41999816894531, "urlname": "streams", "who": "Streamers"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/streams/events/225757803/", "description": "<p><b>FLASH SALE - GET A 50% DISCOUNT ON YOUR TICKET BY NOVEMBER 5TH.\u00a0 <i>USE PROMO CODE: STC50</i>.<br/></b></p> <p><b>CHECK OUT OUR NEW AGENDA ITEMS:\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.spark.tc/datapalooza/full-topics/\"><a href=\"http://www.spark.tc/datapalooza/full-topics/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.spark.tc/datapalooza/full-topics/</a></a></b></p> <p><b>SPACE IS LIMITED - GET YOUR TICKET SOON - 20% DISCOUNT FOR MEETUP MEMBERS!!

His current work involves supporting sales teams with pre-sales and technical specifications for Open Source Analytics tools, specifically Hadoop/Spark and execution of several outreach programs to support Open Source adoption by Analytics teams.\u00a0</p> <p>Before joining IBM he was involved in building some of the large-scale data processing systems at companies like eHarmony, Deem, American Express, Knights Bridge Solutions.</p> ", "how_to_find_us": "Adjust time to your time zone", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 0}, {"created": 1490198202000, "id": "238619679", "name": "Apache Spark and IBM Streams Working Together in Streaming Analytics", "status": "past", "time": 1490716800000, "updated": 1490728898000, "utc_offset": -25200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 16, "venue": {"id": 25124785, "name": "Live Webinar", "lat": 0.0, "lon": 0.0, "repinned": false, "address_1": "http://bit.ly/2o4YZag", "city": "San Francisco", "country": "us", "localized_country_name": "USA", "zip": "", "state": "CA"}, "group": {"created": 1435158878000, "name": "Bay Area Streams", "id": 18695854, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 37.779998779296875, "lon": -122.41999816894531, "urlname": "streams", "who": "Streamers"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/streams/events/238619679/", "description": "<p>Greetings Streamers !!\u00a0</p> <p>Spark is recognized as a great analytics engine. One of its benefits is its inclusion of machine learning algorithms that can group, predict, classify and even recommend based on the analysis of a corpus of data. Once the model is created, it can be applied to new data. In some situations, there is a need to score the model while the data is streaming to decide what to do with the new data.</p> <p>In this latest Data Science Central Webinar event, you will learn\u00a0how to process the data to arrive at a model and how the resulting model can be used to score streaming data using IBM Streams.</p> <p><br/><b>Register Online Here:\u00a0 <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2o4YZag\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2o4YZag\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/2o4YZag</a></a></b></p> ", "how_to_find_us": "Live Webinar is PST.
