If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets.
