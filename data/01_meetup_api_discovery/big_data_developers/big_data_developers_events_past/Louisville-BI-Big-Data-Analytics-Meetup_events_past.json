Now data is at your fingertips, it\u2019s being produced and collated in real time and accessible \u2013 if only we have the wherewithal and talent to leverage it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>To help prepare a new generation of data decision-makers, the Institute is launching a Master of Science in Analytics (MSA) degree this fall. Future plans include cross-disciplinary analytics coursework, certification programs, corporate training, and research and consulting services. Mr. Khandwala will hire faculty and staff, but the Institute will also benefit from the wealth of faculty talent in other disciplines at Bellarmine.</p> <p>The MSA program is an intensive 10-month, full-time, STEM master\u2019s degree, focusing on business and organizations (as opposed to scientific and engineering data analysis). The program is modeled on a pioneering degree at North Carolina State University, where Mr. Khandwala earned his MSA. (He also holds an MBA in management science and marketing from the University of Toronto and a BS in computer science from the University of British Columbia.)</p> <p>A native of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, he attended high school in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Before coming to Bellarmine, he was a researcher and lecturer for various education programs and, most recently, an analytics recruiter for J.P. Morgan Chase.</p> <p>He hopes to enroll 20 students for the first-year program at Bellarmine and escalate to 40 students within three years. Students will come from Louisville, of course, but he will also recruit regionally and nationally and establish industry partnerships.</p> <p>Indications are that there is a huge demand. Conjecturally, almost any organization can make better use of digital data. \u201cBanks, insurance companies and telcos [telecommunications companies] were quickest to datafy their world,\u201d said Mr. Khandwala. Louisville\u2019s major corporations have substantial and exponentially growing data challenges and opportunities.</p> <p>But small organizations, governments and nonprofits can also make use of better analytics. \u201cThe Gartner Report says that by 2018 there will be a shortage of 200,000 to 400,000 analytics professionals or data-savvy professionals across the country,\u201d he said. So it\u2019s not just big business that stands to gain. \u201cA lot of charitable organizations with limited resources use analytics to figure out who they\u2019re likely to get the fastest and best response from,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And analytics, much like the PC, Internet and smartphone revolutions that preceded and helped spawn it, even comes with its own rock stars. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s re-election campaign was a celebrated use of analytics \u2013 the data scientists who worked on that campaign were very savvy people. They are celebrities in our community now,\u201d said Mr. Khandwala.</p> <p>So, who are these future data rock stars? \u201cA lot of our candidates will come straight out of undergrad,\u201d said Mr. Khandwala. \u201cPeople with quantitative aptitude, quantitative training and business understanding. There will also be a lot of career changers \u2013 people who recognize that this is the hot new space. There are organizations clamoring for the position and paying very well for it. And a lot are people who are already doing data work \u2013 business intelligence, producing reports, telling stories with data \u2013 but who want to elevate their skill sets.\u201d</p> <p>One way Bellarmine will do that is by teaching what Mr. Khandwala calls the \u201cart and culture\u201d of analytics. \u201cYou could approach data science or analytics in a purely scientific way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could say, \u2018Here\u2019s how you run certain models; here\u2019s how you extract data; here\u2019s how you write the SQL code; here\u2019s how you get outputs.\u2019 That\u2019s the science behind analytics.</p> <p>\u201cTo me, the art behind analytics is equally important. It is working with the business partners and the other stakeholders in an organization. It\u2019s helping them understand what the organizational needs are, what the challenges are, what business problems they face and working with them to figure out what the priorities should be. How can we better manage our data assets? Which of these problems are most solvable using the data?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the art of analytics. The culture of analytics is an organizational thing. How do we become more data inquisitive? How do we get to a place where all of our conversations can be data-driven? How do we go from thinking deterministically to probabilistically? How do you create a culture where an organization is continually learning about itself from data?\u201d</p> <p>One way students will think deeply about the art and culture of analytics is through intensive, eight-week internships at local organizations. This is a part of the program that benefits the students, benefits the businesses or organizations, and is a foundational concept behind creating an institute and not simply a new master\u2019s degree. \u201cI have no doubt that we can create experiences that are valuable for the student \u2013 working with real data in a real-world situation \u2013 but also create substantive value for the organizations,\u201d said Mr. Khandwala.</p> <p>\u201cOne advantage we have as an institute is to help advance the use of analytics within our organization itself. After the internship, we can bring the students back in to work for a couple of months on a capstone project that is in service to the university.\u201d</p> <p>Another discipline in keeping with Bellarmine\u2019s values is the incorporation of ethics into the program. There are infamous examples of ethical lapses in the era of digital data, from derivatives shenanigans to high-frequency trading, to government spying, to creepy examples like a famous 2012 incident involving Target. The retailer got in hot water by using its data to correctly identify a high school girl as being pregnant \u2013 and sending her coupons for maternity clothes and baby products \u2013 before she had even told her family.</p> <p>\u201cThere are hard questions, not just about security and privacy \u2013 those are germane and beginning to be well understood \u2013 but there are questions that go beyond that: What does it mean to target ethically? How do you incorporate social justice? How do you differentiate without prejudicing? Ethics will be a component of what we\u2019re calling \u2018analytical leadership,\u2019 \u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere are three foundational courses of the program: Analytical Leadership, the Analytical Organization and Foundations to Analytical Thought. This is where we involve the liberal arts \u2013 how do you think analytically, how do you think creatively, what is the right application of logic and the quantitative sciences \u2013 to arrive at what we might loosely call truths.\u201d</p> <p>If that all sounds like a complex turn around the dance floor, consider Mr. Khandwala\u2019s hobby: He\u2019s a Latin dancer. Once a competitive dancer and a teacher of salsa and merengue dancing, he now dances socially. \u201cI\u2019ve found that Louisville has a great community for it. Thursday nights at Sky Bar above Saints in St. Matthews \u2013 it\u2019s the big night for dancing here!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also going to be the faculty sponsor for a Latin-dance club here on campus. That\u2019s a big passion of mine.\u201d</p> ", "how_to_find_us": "Library Room B24", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 3}, {"created": 1412183627000, "duration": 9000000, "id": "210752232", "name": "How do you Visualize your Data?
