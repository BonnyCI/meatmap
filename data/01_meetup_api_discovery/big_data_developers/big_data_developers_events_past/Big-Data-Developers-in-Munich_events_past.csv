Title: Apache Cassandra &amp; Apache Spark for Time Series Data (45 minutes)</p> <p>Presenter: Patrick McFadin</p> <p>Bio: Patrick McFadin is regarded as one of the experts of Apache Cassandra and data modeling techniques. As the Chief Evangelist for Apache Cassandra and consultant for DataStax, he has helped build some of the largest deployments in the world. Previous to DataStax, he was Chief Architect at Hobsons, an education services company. There, he spoke often on Web Application design and performance.</p> <p>Synopsis: Apache Cassandra has proven to be one of the best solutions for storing and retrieving time series data at high velocity and high volume. This talk will discuss how the storage model of Cassandra is ideal for time series use cases and go over examples of how to best build data models. We will also cover pairing Apache Spark with Apache Cassandra to create a real time data analytics platform. Attendees will leave this session knowing how to build their own real time data analytics platform, and will be shocked at how easy it is!</p> ","7200000","1400181332000","14476282","open","48.13999938964844","11.579999923706055","Big Data Developers in Munich","Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich","Members","","217571312","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/217571312/","","Apache Cassandra, Apache Spark and Hadoop Meetup","","","","past","1416333600000","1416393150000","3600000","Gotzinger Str. 8","","München","de","20367322","48.12128448486328","Germany","11.550056457519531","Impact HUB","","False","","","public","0","58"

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets.

The second talk will be held by Matthias J. Sax of Humboldt University Berlin, who will dive deeper into the bowels of <b>processing windows on data streams with Flink</b>. </p> <p><b>Preliminary Schedule</b></p> <p>• 18.30 – Talk 1 (Robert): Stream &amp; Batch Processing with Apache Flink</p> <p>• 19.30 – Dinner Time &amp; socialising</p> <p>• 20.30 – Talk 2 (Matthias): Feeding a Squirrel in Time -- Windows in Apache Flink</p> <p>As always, this Meetup is free for all attendees &amp; Food and Beverages are provided by our<b> host Inovex GmbH</b></p> <p><b>Abstracts</b></p> <p><i>Stream &amp; Batch Processing with Apache Flink</i></p> <p>Apache Flink is an open-source framework for distributed data analysis. Flink is one of the most active big data projects in the Apache Software Foundation and has more than 100 contributors. The core of Flink is a distributed stream processing engine that enables low-latency and high throughput data processing. Flink has high-level APIs for both stream and batch processing.<br/>In the first part of this talk we will briefly look at the history of Flink and then present the APIs and different use cases. Here we will also see how it can be deployed in practice.<br/>In the second part, we will look at the streaming execution engine that powers Flink. Here we will see what makes it tick and also what distinguishes it from other approaches, such as the mini-batch execution model. We will cover Flink's architecture and design decisions that result in Flink's unique set of features.</p> <p><i>Feeding a Squirrel in Time -- Windows in Apache Flink </i></p> <p>In data stream processing, the dimension of time is a crucial aspect with regard to runtime effects as well as query semantics. There are two different time concepts: event-time also called occurrence time, ie, the time in which an event happens in the real world, and processing-time, ie, the time in which an events gets processed by the system. Both time dimensions deliver different semantics if used to specify windows on a data stream.<br/>In this talk, we give an introduction to time-base data stream<br/>processing and cover Flink's approach to handle windowing. Flink offers a broad range of (non-/)deterministic count-, time-, and custom-windows while offering a simple API to express those.</p> <p>Please note that this event has also been posted here: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/""><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/</a></a></p> <p>We would like to thank our host Inovex GmbH for providing the location, food and drinks.</p> ","","1400181332000","14476282","open","48.13999938964844","11.579999923706055","Big Data Developers in Munich","Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich","Members","","226576873","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/226576873/","","Stream & Batch Processing with Apache Flink and Event-Time Windowing","","","","past","1447263000000","1447278875000","3600000","Valentin-Linhof-Straße 2","","München","de","22197842","48.13539123535156","Germany","11.663948059082031","inovex GmbH - Office München","+49 89 726 332 62-0","False","","","public","0","40"

Recently researchers from the University of Toronto implemented a DL Network able to predict Alternative Splicing (AS) patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues using a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data whereas Atomwise, a Silicon Valley based startup evaluates 8.2 million compounds on a IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. GPUs are the key accelerator on DL - that´s why ""In Silico Medicine"" - a startup founded in Baltimore is closely partnering with NVIDIA. DL is at the early stages of development but in this talk we want to motivate machine learning experts to apply these algorithms on their problems and actively contributing to this emerging topic in AI research by providing a Open Source based framework for running massive parallel DL computations on GPU clusters in the Cloud by running DeepLearning4J, ND4J and jcuBLAS on top of ApacheSpark.
