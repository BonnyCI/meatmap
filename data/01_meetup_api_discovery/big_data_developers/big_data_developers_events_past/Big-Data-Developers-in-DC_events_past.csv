You can issue JDBC queries or ODBC queries to access data that is stored in InfoSphere BigInsights, in the same way that you access databases from your enterprise applications.</p> <p><br/>You can use Big SQL to issue queries of any size, including concurrent queries. Big SQL provides support for large ad-hoc queries by using MapReduce parallelism and point queries, which are low-latency queries that return information quickly to reduce response time and provide improved access to data.  </p> <p>


HBase is a column-oriented database management system that runs on top of HDFS. It is well suited for sparse data sets, which are common in many big data use cases. Unlike relational database systems, HBase does not support a structured query language like SQL; in fact, HBase isn’t a relational data store at all.  HBase applications are typically written in Java much like a MapReduce application or in other languages by using Apache Thrift.  However, HBase can be queried with SQL when combined with Hive and or Big SQL!</p> <p>


Apache Accumulo, like HBase, derives from Google's BigTable technology.  While the two technologies are similar in architecture, Accumulo excels in security right down to the cell level.  Attendees will receive an introduction to Apache Accumulo and hear about IBM's Accumulo research project.</p> <p>

<b>Join us from 11:00am - 6:00pm on February the 4th to learn about Big SQL, Hive and HBase. Register at: <a href=""http://ibm.co/19APszk""><a href=""http://ibm.co/19APszk"" class=""linkified"">http://ibm.co/19APszk</a></a></b></p> <p>

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.</p> <p>Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets.

"8","1460581152000","<p>The rise of NoSQL databases has changed the way we think about storing data. For years, on-premise relational databases have been the standard method of data storage across the IT industry. Some applications, however, have benefited greatly by making the shift to a NoSQL data store. Rising to prominence in the mid-2000's, NoSQL gained a solid traction with the boom in mobile technology. Today NoSQL databases are a critical element of countless traditional, mobile, and Internet of Things applications.</p> <p>With IBM's ""Open for Data"" cloud computing initiative, current and prospective users can provision a NoSQL database in a matter of minutes without a hefty up-front infrastructure investment.
