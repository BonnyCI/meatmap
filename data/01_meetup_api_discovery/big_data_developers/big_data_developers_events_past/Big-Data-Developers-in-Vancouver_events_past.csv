If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.

Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.</p> <p>Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets.
