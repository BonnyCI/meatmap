If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative. Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.</p> <p>Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 7}, {"created": 1434575921000, "duration": 5400000, "id": "223316794", "name": "A closer look at IBM's General Parallel File System (GPFS) for Hadoop", "status": "past", "time": 1435105800000, "updated": 1435130988000, "utc_offset": -25200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 42, "venue": {"id": 23913374, "name": "Simba Technologies Inc.", "lat": 49.26403045654297, "lon": -123.12525939941406, "repinned": false, "address_1": "938 West 8th Avenue", "city": "Vancouver", "country": "ca", "localized_country_name": "Canada", "zip": "", "state": "BC"}, "group": {"created": 1398141265000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Vancouver", "id": 14038802, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 49.279998779296875, "lon": -123.12000274658203, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Vancouver", "who": "Big Data Enthusiasts"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Vancouver/events/223316794/", "description": "<p>You've heard of HDFS,.. how about GPFS?</p> <p>GPFS is has been powering the worlds largest supercomputers for more than a decade - for example:</p> <p>- Leibniz Supercomputing Centre in Munich @ 9500 nodes<br/>- National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) @ 4500<br/>- Argonne National Laboratory Mira System 49,152 compute nodes</p> <p>Now this technology is available for Apache Hadoop and we'd like to show you what's under the covers.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 2}, {"created": 1446529064000, "id": "226505459", "name": "Getting started with Data Science (Panel) and Introduction to Watson Analytics", "status": "past", "time": 1446600600000, "updated": 1446613384000, "utc_offset": -28800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "yes_rsvp_count": 3, "venue": {"id": 24187520, "name": "University of British Colombia-Pharmaceutic\u00adal Sciences Building (Room 1101)", "lat": 49.261375427246094, "lon": -123.25366973876953, "repinned": false, "address_1": "2329 West Mall", "city": "Vancouver", "country": "ca", "localized_country_name": "Canada", "zip": "", "state": "BC"}, "group": {"created": 1398141265000, "name": "Big Data Developers in Vancouver", "id": 14038802, "join_mode": "open", "lat": 49.279998779296875, "lon": -123.12000274658203, "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Vancouver", "who": "Big Data Enthusiasts"}, "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Vancouver/events/226505459/", "description": "<p><b><i>RSVPing to this meetup is not enough to attend.\u00a0</i><i>Please register \u00a0 ===&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><a href=\"http://bigdatauniversity.com/events/beginners-getting-started-with-data-science-panel-and-introduction-to-watson-analytics-vancouver/\">here</a><i>&lt;&lt;&lt;===</i></b></p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>Join us on this exciting event where we will feature:</p> <p>1) A panel about how to get started in Data Science</p> <p>Panelists will answer questions like,</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\"What are local data scientists in this city working on?\",</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\"How do you find a job in data science?\",</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\"What programming languages do data scientists use?\"...<a href=\"http://bigdatauniversity.com/events/beginners-getting-started-with-data-science-panel-and-introduction-to-watson-analytics-vancouver/\">more</a></p> <p>Pre-requisites:</p> <p>Sign up to the free version of Watson Analytics prior to the event at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.watsonanalytics.com/\">www.watsonanalytics.com</a></p> <p><b>Presenter(s):\u00a0</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/karen-mott/3/469/8b3\">Karen Mott</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/polonglin\">Polong Lin</a></p> <p><br/><b>Free Pizza and Drinks!

First, we'll take a closer look at Apache Spark - one of the most exciting and fastest growing open source projects in big data. Afterward, we'll tackle the common challenge of querying data on Hadoop by comparing the latest and greatest SQL technologies. Each has a sweet spot and we'll try to do a broad coverage of the leading technologies.</p> ", "visibility": "public", "comment_count": 8}]
