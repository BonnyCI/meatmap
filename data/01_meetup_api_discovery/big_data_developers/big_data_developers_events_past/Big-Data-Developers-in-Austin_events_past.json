This is a great opportunity to learn more about IBM's Big Data and Analytics. Join us for a hands-on technical session to learn all about the key capabilities in the IBM Big Data and Analytics portfolio. We will also feature Watson Analytics, how to get started via our Cloud-based Bluemix tools, and how these offerings can solve real business problems. All of these key capabilities are illustrated via a real life Internet of Things application which was developed especially for this event. The IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics Day is offered as two half day sessions: Essentials overview and demo is targeted at business types and executives, and the Hands-on Workshop is the key component for IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics Day designed with developers as the target audience. These events are tailored for developers and business leaders to understand the value and essentials of the IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics portfolio. Through demonstrations and hands-on labs you will see the Architecture of the Solution, Open Cloud environment with IBM Bluemix, Connected devices, Utilization of Cloudant DBaaS, Hadoop and MapReduce, Building the Analytics layer with SPSS and R. 1.

The goal is to get users to click on online ads, which ultimately generates revenue for the ad sponsors. This is a hard problem to solve, given the magnitude of combinations of users, webpages and ad sponsors. It is also a great success story for scalable Machine Learning.\u00a0</p> <p>In this talk, we discuss the Kaggle competetion on click through rate prediction, which is an important metric for evaluating online ad performance. Using the dataset from Kaggle, we use Spark MLLib to create a pipeline for data parsing, feature extraction, model creation, model evaluation and finally prediction.\"</p> <p><b>Prerequisites / Level: </b><br/>This is an Intermediate level talk, where attendee is expected to know the basics of Spark and Machine Learning.</p> <p><b>What to Bring: </b><br/>Laptop (optional)</p> <p><b>Meet Your Speaker: </b><br/>Manisha Sule is a software engineer currently working with IBM's Spark Technology Center.

Today teams are using a JSON document store for scale, a graphing database to create connections, a message queue to handle messaging, a caching system to accelerate responses, a time-series database for streaming data, a relational DB for metrics and more. It can be hard to stay on top of all of your options or to visualize how this can all work together.</p> <p><i><b>Why you should attend:</b></i><br/>While much talk in developer circles these days focuses on the app layer, we feel not enough attention is put on the data layer. Data is the secret ingredient to ensuring apps are optimized for speed, security and user experience. We're putting together an agenda that puts a light on how teams are leveraging various data services (and not just the ones that Compose supports!) to architect beautiful apps.
