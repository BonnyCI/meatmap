"29","1382024106000","<p>Join us and participate in an exclusive Big Data and Analytics Developer Evening hosted by the IBM Big Data and Analytics team.   Open source Apache Hadoop is a great framework for distributed processing of large data sets. But there’s a difference between ""playing"" with big data versus solving real problems. The reality is that Hadoop alone might not be enough. Experience IBM’s <b>enterprise-class Hadoop</b> product, InfoSphere BigInsights, which enhances open source Hadoop with required enterprise capabilities including: analytics, visualisation, security, standard SQL, enterprise HBase, developer/admin tools.</p> <p>We will kick off with <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata/use-cases.html"">Big Data use case</a> discussions and an overview of what big data really is, and then move quickly to get hands-on with Big Data using <a href=""http://ibm.co/quickstart"">InfoSphere BigInsights Quick Start Edition</a> with guidance from development experts. This is a unique opportunity to develop skills and learn about exciting technologies and techniques that you can immediately take back to your organisation.</p> <p><b>This event is <i>FREE</i>.</b> Drinks and some food will be provided.</p> <p>Agenda (subject to change) <br/>6.30pm to 7pm Arrivals &amp; Registration</p> <p>7pm to 7.15pm Welcome and Keynote - <b>Big Data Overview</b></p> <p>7.15pm to 7.30pm <b>Big Data @ Rest (Hadoop)</b></p> <p>7.30pm to 9pm <b>Hands-on Lab</b> - tentative labs</p> <p>            • Lever the full power of SQL with Hadoop</p> <p>Labs will use <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/biginsights/quick-start/"">BigInsights Quick Start VM</a>.  To learn more beforehand and get hands on go to <a href=""http://bigdatauniversity.com/"">Big Data University</a>.  By downloading the IBM BigInsights Quick Start Edition VM <b>in advance,</b> participants will have the chance to get hands on with IBM's enterprise-class Hadoop distribution. A facilitated lab exercise will walk through the process of generating and loading data and then creating the necessary structures to query it using IBM's full ANSI standard SQL interface. This will demonstrate some of the power and flexibility of IBM's platform.</p> <p>9pm Close and Thank You for Attending </p> <p>Seating is limited, please adjust your RSVP accordingly.</p> <p>Registration is required.  This event is limited to only 60 seated and 40 standing. You may let others know that you are going to this event by clicking on the YES RSVP button on this Meetup page—however— your seat can not be guaranteed until you officially register at the link above.</p> <p>Thanks and we look forward to seeing you soon!</p> ","9000000","1374780559000","9516272","open","51.5099983215332","-0.07999999821186066","Big Data Developers in London","Big-Data-Analytics-in-London","Data Mashers","","146058592","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Analytics-in-London/events/146058592/","","Inaugural Big Data and Analytics Developer Meetup","PT26H30M","100","","past","1384972200000","1385034222000","0","76/78 Upper Ground","Southbank","London","gb","1432252","51.50695037841797","United Kingdom","-0.11143799871206284","IBM Southbank (SE1 9PZ)","","False","","","public","0","83"

<i>Are you interested in getting to grips with machine learning, and how it can be used to create an Internet of Things system with IBM SystemML and Apache Spark? </i></p> <p>


Nikolay Manchev (Big Data Technical Specialist, IBM Analytics) will cover IBM's commitment to Spark, how IBM SystemML can help advance machine learning, how to roll out machine learning algorithms in production and how to achieve shorter development times and increased algorithm performance</p> <p>



Jan Machacek (Cake Solutions) will explore the latest developments of the MUVR project. After a brief introduction on the nature of distributed systems (from distributed databases, through distributed state, to distributed computation), you will learn how to use Akka Cluster and Akka Persistence to implement such distributed systems. Once the data is safely stored in a journal, it is important to be able to perform deeper analysis. To do so, Jan will show you how to access the data in the journal in a distributed computation program running in Apache Spark.</p> <p>With the mechanics done, Jan will explain how to use (deep) neural networks that can be very easily trained to recognize patterns in the ingested data.</p> <p>You will learn the advantages and traps of designing distributed domains, data and computation: systems that may become the next generation of financial systems, bringing elasticity, resilience and responsiveness. You will look in particular at systems that consume data from IoT / wearables, and that perform immediate and batch analyses.</p> <p>

We're now building thinking tools and machines to help us with mental tasks, in the same way that mechanical robots already help us with physical work. Older technologies are being combined with newly-created smart ones to meet the demands of the emerging experience economy. We are now in-between two computing ages: the older, transactional computing era and a new cognitive one. </p> <p>In this new world, Big Data is a must-have resource for any cutting-edge enterprise project.  And this Big Data serves as an excellent resource for building intelligence of all kinds: artificial smartness, intelligence as a service, emotional intelligence, invisible interfaces, and attempts at true general AI. However, often with new projects you have no data to begin with. So the challenge is, how do you acquire or produce data? During this session, Vasyl will discuss what the process of creation of new technology to solve business problems, and the strategies for approaching the “No Data Challenge”, including:</p> <p>·  Using software and hardware agents capable of recording new types of data;</p> <p>·  The five Sources of Big Data;</p> <p>·  The Six Graphs of Big Data as strategies for modern solutions; and</p> <p>·  The Eight Exponential Technologies.</p> <p>This new era of computing is all about the end user or professional user, and these new AI tools will help to improve their lifestyle and solve their problems.</p> <p><b>Vasyl Mylko</b> is responsible for research and thought leadership including Cognitive Computing, Emotional Intelligence,  Internet of Things, Healthcare,  Advanced Analytics, User Experience and Mobility and Wearables.

They represent data as ‘vertices’, sometimes called ‘nodes’. The relationships between vertices are represented by connections called ‘edges’. Graph databases also store metadata or ‘properties’ about vertices and edges. Graph database applications came to prominence when modeling complex networks of related data, include modelling and applying social networks, constructing and developing recommendation engines, and ‘optimal route’ challenges such as finding the shortest path or solving the vehicle routing problem.

<b>Finding hidden insight in your unstructured data</b></p> <p>Every day we produce 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data – the majority of which is unstructured. This data is full of potentially valuable insights; from root causes of product failures in customer reviews to systemic process failures spread across audit reports. But it is vastly underutilised because of the complexity and challenges in analysing and understanding unstructured data. This session introduces Watson Knowledge Studio which uses the power of supervised machine learning to build powerful, custom tailored models that can be used to identify entities and relationships in unstructured text in the way that makes the most sense for business applications.h</p> <p>Chris Withers leads the Financial Services practice for IBM Watson in Europe.

IPython notebook is an established tool in the Data Science community and embedding the application's Spark Context within it, can speed up development and limit errors. One possible usage model is to share a set of precomputed RDDs cached in Spark's cluster memory between multiple users. This approach reduces the resource usage, since the precomputation happens only once and the cached data is not replicated for each user. Sharing SQL contexts allows instantaneous access to temporary results by other users. We’ll conclude the session with presenting how this solution helped to bring interactive notebooks into our flagship Big Data processing platform: Seahorse.</p> <p>Piotr Łusakowsk, Technical Leader, deepsense.io</p> <p>Piotr graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics at University of Warsaw.

<b>Analysing social media conversation during the 2016 Wimbledon Tournament </b></p> <p>The Summer of 2016 was unusual in sporting terms, with several events taking place simultaneously (Euro 2016 Football Championships, 2016 Copa América, the Tour de France, two F1 Grand Prix and the build up to the Rio Olympics). The packed schedule presented a challenge to Wimbledon, in vying for sports fans attention, but also an opportunity to draw in fans from other sports. In order to make their own editorial content relevant, Wimbledon needed to understand what tennis and general sports fans were talking about and where their interests lay.</p> <p>The Cognitive Social Command Centre (CSCC) used IBM's Watson technology &amp; the Spark platform to identify, in real-time, emerging topics of conversation around Wimbledon and the other sports events. It highlighted which of those topics had the potential to perform best and what content was being engaged with now. By using a Cognitive solution that was trained not programmed, the system was continually improving throughout the Championships, learning what was being said about Wimbledon and the other sporting events.</p> <p>Adelina Balasa, Technical Consultant, IBM Cloud</p> <p><br/>Adelina has been with IBM for 3 years and during this time she’s developed a very broad set of skills, from technical expertise to project management to creative work.

Willem Hendrik will start with the basics and hopefully get everybody enthusiastic about this emerging technology. He will then demonstrate a step by step method that will enable you to start building and training networks.</p> <p><i>Willem Hendriks</i> studied Mathematics at TU Delft (the Netherlands). He is currently undertaking various Big Data related projects at IBM, as a data scientist</p> <p><b>Using Deep Learning to Design the Molecules of Tomorrow </b></p> <p>In theory, there are more potential stable molecules than there are atoms in the universe. So how do we find new molecules for the drugs, materials, additives (etc) of the future? High-throughput virtual screening now allows us to scan millions of molecules, but this is still many orders of magnitude too small. The use of deep learning can both accelerate our search by speeding up (for example) property calculations, and by moving us towards an intelligent means of searching this vast space. I will introduce various types of neural network, and show how you can use them to speed up search problems by coupling them with a state of the art technique called Bayesian Optimization.</p> <p>&lt;a href=""https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/edward-pyzer-knapp""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; <i>Edward Pyzer-Knapp</i> obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge using simulation-based techniques to help guide experimental materials design. He then moved to Harvard where he was in charge of the day-to-day running of the Harvard Clean Energy project, which was a collaboration with IBM which combined massive distributed computing, quantum-mechanical simulations, and machine-learning to accelerate discovery of the next generation of organic photovoltaic materials. Now, Edward works for IBM Research UK, leading the large-scale machine learning research effort with a specific interest in bringing cutting edge techniques from machine learning and data science to the physical and life sciences.</p> ","","1374780559000","9516272","open","51.5099983215332","-0.07999999821186066","Big Data Developers in London","Big-Data-Analytics-in-London","Data Mashers","","239506675","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Analytics-in-London/events/239506675/","","A shallow dive into Deep Learning","","","","past","1494267300000","1494367051000","3600000","London","","EC2M 7EB","gb","24214872","51.51856231689453","United Kingdom","-0.08624500036239624","CodeNode - 10 South Place","","False","","","public","0","309"

DeepLearning4J features all this without forcing you to learn new exotic programming languages and in addition also scales-out on well established infrastructures like ApacheSpark and Hadoop/YARN. In this talk we will introduce DeepLearning4J on top of ApacheSpark with an example to create an anomaly detector for IoT sensor data with a LSTM auto encoder neural network.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:</p> <p>

They play a huge role in accelerating applications that have a large number of parallelizable tasks such as machine learning, data analysis or similar. Learn how Java can exploit the power of GPUs to optimize high-performance computing applications, through both explicit GPU programming and letting the Java JIT compiler transparently off-load work to the GPU.</p> <p><br/>This presentation covers the principles and considerations for GPU programming from Java and looks at the software stack and developer tools available.
