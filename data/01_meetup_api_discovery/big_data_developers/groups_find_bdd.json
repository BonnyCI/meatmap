Adem\u00e1s proporciona un marco muy bueno para conocer a otras personas interesadas en estas tecnolog\u00edas, compartir experiencias (networking) y pasar momentos agradables. <br></p>\n<p>Hacemos 2 tipos de meetups:</p>\n<p>1) Unos que son por la ma\u00f1ana que normalmente contienen&nbsp; presentaciones y demos t\u00e9cnicas y despu\u00e9s un laboratorio para practicar lo que se ha contado (la duraci\u00f3n suele ser toda la ma\u00f1ana). <br></p>\n<p>2) Otros que suelen ser por la tarde (despu\u00e9s del trabajo) , en los que hay presentaciones y demos t\u00e9cnicas pero no suelen tener laboratorios pr\u00e1cticos. Estos suelen ser m\u00e1s cortos (ej. de 18:00 a 20:00). <br></p>\n<p>Nota: En cualquier caso la agenda con las horas se detallan cada vez.</p>\n<p>Adem\u00e1s de buenas charlas t\u00e9cnicas, una parte esencial de nuestros Meetups son las pizzas y las cervezas (espero que nunca fallen!).</p>\n<p>Procuramos que las presentaciones aunque t\u00e9cnicas cualquiera las pueda seguir aunque no tenga un conocimiento de la materia en cuesti\u00f3n. <br></p>\n<p>Nuestros meetups son gratuitos. <br></p>\n<p>Nuestros meetups incluyen tecnolog\u00edas como: <br></p>\n<p>- Hadoop/Spark. <br></p>\n<p>- Stream Computing.</p>\n<p>- Big SQL. <br></p>\n<p>- Text Analytics.</p>\n<p>- Machine Learning. <br></p>\n<p>- Desarrollos de aplicaciones Big Data. <br></p>\n<p>- En general cualquier tema

Capabilities include Java, mobile back-end development, and application monitoring, as well as features from ecosystem partners and open source - all provided as-a-service in the cloud.&nbsp;<br>Bluemix is built on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cloudfoundry.org/\">Cloud Foundry</a>&nbsp;open source technology that provides mobile and web developers access to IBM software for integration, security, transaction, and other key functions, as well as software from business partners. Bluemix offers more control to application developers by using its Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering, and also provides pre-built Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) capabilities. The goal is to simplify the delivery of an application by providing services that are ready for immediate use and hosting capabilities to enable internal scale development.&nbsp;<br>With the broad set of services and runtimes in Bluemix, the developer gains control and flexibility, and has access to various data options, from predictive analytics to big data.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/96960515-2ea1-4391-8170-b0515d08e4da/entry/wake_up_to_cloud_and_bluemix?lang=en\">Wake up to Cloud and Bluemix!</a>&nbsp;<br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<br>", "created": 1425465657000, "city": "Jakarta", "country": "ID", "localized_country_name": "Indonesia", "state": "", "join_mode": "open", "visibility": "public", "lat": -6.18, "lon": 106.83, "members": 531, "organizer": {"id": 202914579, "name": "Irsan Suryadi Saputra", "bio": ""}, "who": "Developer", "group_photo": {"id": 444569277, "highres_link": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/5/d/highres_444569277.jpeg", "photo_link": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/5/d/600_444569277.jpeg", "thumb_link": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/5/d/thumb_444569277.jpeg", "type": "event", "base_url": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}, "key_photo": {"id": 446235002, "highres_link": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/9/a/highres_446235002.jpeg", "photo_link": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/9/a/600_446235002.jpeg", "thumb_link": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/9/a/thumb_446235002.jpeg", "type": "event", "base_url": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}, "timezone": "Asia/Jakarta", "category": {"id": 34, "name": "Tech", "shortname": "Tech", "sort_name": "Tech"}, "join_info": {"questions_req": false, "photo_req": true}}, {"score": 1.0, "id": 9505792, "name": "Big Data Developers in Nairobi", "link": "https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Nairobi/", "urlname": "Big-Data-Developers-in-Nairobi", "description": "<p>This is an IBM sponsored Big Data meetup group.\ufffd Geared towards developers, data scientists and ALL Big Data enthusiasts, our meetups provide an opportunity to work hands on with the solutions and tools in our Big Data portfolio.
