"34","Tech","Tech","Tech","Madrid","ES","1364206309000","<p>Hola!! <br></p>
<p>Este es un grupo de Meetup de Big Data esponsorizado por IBM, dirigido a científicos de datos, ingenieros, desarrolladores y todos los entusiastas del Big Data o que quieren aprender sobre estas interesantes materias. Además proporciona un marco muy bueno para conocer a otras personas interesadas en estas tecnologías, compartir experiencias (networking) y pasar momentos agradables. <br></p>
<p>Hacemos 2 tipos de meetups:</p>
<p>1) Unos que son por la mañana que normalmente contienen&nbsp; presentaciones y demos técnicas y después un laboratorio para practicar lo que se ha contado (la duración suele ser toda la mañana). <br></p>
<p>2) Otros que suelen ser por la tarde (después del trabajo) , en los que hay presentaciones y demos técnicas pero no suelen tener laboratorios prácticos. Estos suelen ser más cortos (ej. de 18:00 a 20:00). <br></p>
<p>Nota: En cualquier caso la agenda con las horas se detallan cada vez.</p>
<p>Además de buenas charlas técnicas, una parte esencial de nuestros Meetups son las pizzas y las cervezas (espero que nunca fallen!).</p>
<p>Procuramos que las presentaciones aunque técnicas cualquiera las pueda seguir aunque no tenga un conocimiento de la materia en cuestión. <br></p>
<p>Nuestros meetups son gratuitos. <br></p>
<p>Nuestros meetups incluyen tecnologías como: <br></p>
<p>- Hadoop/Spark. <br></p>
<p>- Stream Computing.</p>
<p>- Big SQL. <br></p>
<p>- Text Analytics.</p>
<p>- Machine Learning. <br></p>
<p>- Desarrollos de aplicaciones Big Data. <br></p>
<p>- En general cualquier tema relacionado con la tecnología de Big Data.</p>
<p>Espero que os gusten! <br></p>
<p>Un abrazo</p>
