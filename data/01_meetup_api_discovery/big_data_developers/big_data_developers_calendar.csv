"1494931473000","<p>Graphic processing units (GPUs) are not just for playing games. They play a huge role in accelerating applications that have a large number of parallelizable tasks such as machine learning, data analysis or similar. Learn how Java can exploit the power of GPUs to optimize high-performance computing applications, through both explicit GPU programming and letting the Java JIT compiler transparently off-load work to the GPU.</p> <p><br/>This presentation covers the principles and considerations for GPU programming from Java and looks at the software stack and developer tools available.

Apache Spark has APIs in Scala, Java, Python and more recently a few different attempts to provide support for R, C#, and Julia. This talk looks at Apache Spark from a performance/scaling point of view and the work we need to do to be able to handle large datasets.

SystemML allows data scientists to write code once in terms of high-level linear algebra operations, then automatically generate low-level parallel versions of the program that are tuned to the characteristics of the data and different parallel execution frameworks. The system consists of two major components: An optimizer that automatically parallelizes high-level code; and a runtime that evaluates the resulting execution plans at scale on Apache Hadoop, on Apache Spark, on large multi-core systems, and, more recently, on GPUs.  This talk will start by describing the history of the project. I'll explain how the original research team from IBM advanced the state of the art in automatic parallelization and scalable linear algebra to build the optimizer and runtime, and how we turned the resulting research code into Apache SystemML. I'll describe how Apache SystemML has been used to implement state-of-the-art algorithms in the field.

If you have a relatively small data set you might still have a big computational problem. One problem is the search for optimal parameters for ML algorithms. Normally, a data scientist has a laptop with 4 cores (8 threads), that means it will take some time to perform a grid search …However, if you use Spark, then it opens the possibility to have the grid search taken out on a cluster with a higher degree of parallelism, thus reduce the time to find optimal parameters. This leads to a more interactive workflow and more fun during the modelling phase.</p> <p>2)  TBD - will post shortly.</p> <p><br/>Please ensure you bring a picture ID.  Light refreshments will be served.</p> ","7200000","1338938692000","4013112","open","37.18000030517578","-121.75","Big Data Developers","BigDataDevelopers","Members","Maker Room","240119549","https://www.meetup.com/BigDataDevelopers/events/240119549/","","Apache Spark - Cool Magic and ML Futures","","","upcoming","1496885400000","1495227698000","-25200000","505 Howard Street","San Francisco","US","25252319","37.7881965637207","USA","-122.39610290527344","IBM Watson","False","","","public","0","34"

"1495655775000","<p>Where do you start when analysing data? Want to know how you can use your Java and Scala skills to analyse data fully? Then join our June Big Data Developers meetup with Adam Roberts - don't miss it!</p> <p>You’ve heard about data analytics. You’ve even got a little data. but how do you get started with analysing your data and what exactly could you look for? In this talk Adam Roberts will explain how you can easily use your Java or Scala skills to analyse data and get real (and sometimes unexpected) insights. We’ll show you how you do not always need large amounts of money, time or computing resource to get meaningful results . With code and demonstrations we will walk you through the steps needed to deploy and use a complete solution that will run on your laptop. Your first steps on the data analytics path starts here. Who knows what you’ll discover.</p> <p><b>If you are planning to attend, please RSVP here AND register at <a href=""https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8282-diy-data-analytics-with-apache-spark"">SkillsMatter</a>.</b><a href=""https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/adam-roberts""><br/></a></p> <p><b><a href=""https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/adam-roberts"">Adam Roberts</a></b></p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/0/4/6/600_461265126.jpeg"" /></p> <p>Adam spends his time deep in IBM Java/Apache Spark's codebase and regularly helps customers to use Spark for the first time. He works on Spark quality assurance, optimising Spark performance, fixing bugs in Spark or related projects such as Zeppelin/Hadoop, and has a keen interest in using GPU hardware accelerators to maximise throughput. He's responsible for delivering IBM's Development Package for Apache Spark and wants to help people get started with Spark, share working code, and learn from other's experiences. Adam also teaches machine learning techniques to IBMers and the basics to children, and has an additional interest in analysing data for ourselves gathered from IoT devices.</p> <p>18:15  - 18:30  Registration</p> <p>18:30 - 19:15   DIY Data Analytics with Apache Spark</p> <p><br/>19:15  - 20:00 Drinks and networking</p> <p><b><a href=""http://ibm.biz/IBMCodeUK"">ibm.biz/IBMCodeUK</a></b></p> ","","1374780559000","9516272","open","51.5099983215332","-0.07999999821186066","Big Data Developers in London","Big-Data-Analytics-in-London","Data Mashers","","240245196","https://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Analytics-in-London/events/240245196/","","DIY Data Analytics with Apache Spark","","","upcoming","1498151700000","1495655775000","3600000","London","EC2M 7EB","gb","24214872","51.51856231689453","United Kingdom","-0.08624500036239624","CodeNode - 10 South Place","False","","","public","0","87"
